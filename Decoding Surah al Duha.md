# Decoding Surah al Duha

## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (مكية). It talks about the character/personality of the greatest prophet, peace be upon him, and the blessings and graces that Allah most High bestowed upon him in this world and the next so that he could thank Him by these amazing blessings.

The chapter begins with the swearing upon the loftiness of the magnitude of the prophet, peace be upon him. Verily, his Lord has not abandoned him and does not hate him as the disbelievers claim. On the contrary, his destiny, place and affair are elevated in the eyes of Allah most High [93:1-4]

Then, the chapter brings the good news of a lot of rewards in the next life, and about what Allah promised him which is a type of miracle, namely the great intercession. [93: 5]

Thereafter, it reminds him of his state when he was a child, how he was an orphan, poor, needy and lost. Then, his Lord provided shelter of him, enriched him and took care of him. [93: 6-8]

The chapter concludes with advice in three commands that juxtapose to the three blessings mentioned above. These commands are being favourably disposed to orphans, being merciful to the needy and consoling the tears of the miserable, and it closes with order and symmetry of the beauty of language with a magnificent proclamation of originality and loftiness.
