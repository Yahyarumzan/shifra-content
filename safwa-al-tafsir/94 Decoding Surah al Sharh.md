# Decoding Surah al Sharh

## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It talks about the noble rank of the messenger peace be upon him and his exalted rank with Allah most High. Indeed, the discussion is about the numerous blessings of Allah upon His messenger and servant *Muhammad*, peace be upon him, such as the expansion of his chest with belief, the illumination of his heart with wisdom and perception and his purification from sins and burdens. The purpose of these reminders is to console and soothe the messenger of Allah when he faced hardship from the lying disbelievers for his noble sake with the lights that Allah most High blessed him (Verses 1-3)

Then, it talks about the raising of the rank of the messenger, peace be upon him, in this life and the next as he connected his name, peace be upon him, with the name of Allah most High (Verse 4)

The chapter then describes the calling of the messenger, peace be upon him, while he was in *Makkah* with the believers and the suffering from the opposition of the disbelieving liars and hardship therein, consoling him with the proximity of relief and victory upon his enemies. (Verses 5-6)

The chapter concludes with a reminder to *Mustafa*, peace be upon him, regarding the duty to focus on worshipping Allah after finishing to spread the message and gratitude to Allah for the exalted blessings bestowed upon him. (Verses 7-8)

## Explanation

```
94:1 أَلَمْ نَشْرَحْ لَكَ صَدْرَكَ
```

The use of the question particle `أَ` here is for emphasis and repetition. That is, have we not expanded your breast, O *Muhammad* with guidance and belief, the light of the *Koran* as Allah most High says in the Koran (6:125):

> And whomsoever God wills to guide, his chest He opens wide with willingness towards self-surrender [unto Him]

Ibn Kathir said:

> That is, we have illuminated him and rendered him wide and ample as Allah expanded his breast. Similarly, He has made the rules for him wide, kind and easy so that he does not leave and does not feel confined.

Abu Hiyan said:

> The expansion of his chest indicates illumination with guidance

```
94:2 وَوَضَعْنَا عَنكَ وِزْرَكَ
```

O *Muhammad*, your Lord has not left you because he has chosen you and he does not hate you because he loves you and this is the reply to the disbelievers when they said: 

> Your Lord has left you

And it is the answer to the oath in verses one and two.

```
93:4 وَلَلْـَٔاخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لَّكَ مِنَ ٱلْأُولَىٰ
```

The abode of the next life is better for you, O *Muhammad* than the life of this world because the next life is eternal whilst this world is finite and this is why the righteous say:

> O Allah, there is no life except the life of the next world.

```
93:5 وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَىٰٓ
```

Your Lord shall give you in the next life many rewards, among which are miraculous happenings, mainly in the shape of intercession so that you will be completely content. Ibn Abas said:

> This intercession is for his people until he his content. 

It was narrated that verily the prophet, *peace be upon him*, remembered his people and said: 

> O Allah, my people, my people

and cried. So Allah said:

> O Jibril, go to Muhammad and ask him why is the cause of his crying

Although Allah already knows. Then, Jibril went to the prophet, *peace be upon him*, and asked him and the prophet, *peace be upon*, informed him. Then, Allah said:

> O Jibril, go to Muhammad and tell him, We will satisfy you with your people, so don't grieve.

And in the following narration: 

> There is for each prophet, special requests that are guaranteed to be answered. Hence, all prophets hasten to ask. Verily, I have concealed your asking for your people on the day of judgement.

And another narration, *Khazin* said: 

> First, a sign was carried upon its back, certainly comprising the good of this world and the next with it. So Allah gave him victory in this world, victory upon the enemies and a lot of following and openings and the most elevated of religions, and made his people the best of people and gave him in the next world, general intercession and a praised rank and other than this among the good in this world and the next.

Thereafter, after Allah made this amazing promise to him, he reminded him of the blessings upon him whilst he was young, so that he thanks his Lord. So, Allah said:

```
93:6 أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيمًا فَـَٔاوَىٰ
```

That is, were you not *Muhammad*, an orphan in your youth and Allah protected you with your uncle *Abu Talib* and put you under his care? *Ibn Kathir* said: 

> His father passed away whilst his mother was still pregnant of him. Then, his mother passed away whilst he was six years old. Then he was in the care of his grandfather, *Abdul Mutalib* and the latter passed away whilst he was eight years old. Then, he was taken care of by his uncle *Abu Talib*, and then, protection and victory did not leave him, and he was raised by Allah's power, until Allah sent him the message, above the forty chiefs, whilst *Abu Talib* was worshipping the idols like his people. Thereafter, hardship followed the prophet, *peace be upon him*, and all of this was from Allah's protection and out of care for him.

```
93:7 وَوَجَدَكَ ضَآلًّا فَهَدَىٰ
```

Did we not find you stray from the knowledge of the religion and it's rules, then we guided you unto it. As Allah says:

```
42:52 مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِي مَا الْكِتَابُ وَلَا الْإِيمَانُ
```

*Imam Al Jalil* said: 

> That is, we found you ignorant related to what you did not know at the time about the rules of religion and then we guided you upon it. 

And it was said:

> He was lost in the outskirts of *Makkah* whilst he was young and Allah guided him back to his grandfather. 

*Abu Hiyan* said:

> It is not benefitting to say that he was taken to guidance after being ignorant as prophets are protected from this. 

*Ibn Abas* said:

> This ignorance refers back to whilst he was lost in *Makkah* when he was young.

It is said:

> He was lost whilst he was with his uncle on the way to *Sham*.

```
93:8 وَوَجَدَكَ عَآئِلًا فَأَغْنَىٰ
```

We found you poor and needy and we enriched in the world such as we facilitated for you the means of trade... Then, after these three blessings have been enumerated, he is advised with juxtaposing counsels. And Allah says:

```
93:9 فَأَمَّا ٱلْيَتِيمَ فَلَا تَقْهَرْ
```

That is, do not scorn or degrade the orphan, and don't take his wealth. *Mujahid* said: 

> Don't despise him. 

*Sufian* said: 

> Don't wrong him by wasting his wealth.

What is meant here, be with the orphan as a merciful father, for you were an orphan and Allah protected you.

```
93:10 وَأَمَّا ٱلسَّآئِلَ فَلَا تَنْهَرْ
```

That is, regarding the begging asker who is asking out of need and poverty, don't drive him away when he asks. Don't speak in a rude fashion to him. Give him or reply to him with a beautiful speech. Qatadah said:

> Reply to the poor with kindness and softness.

```
93:11 وَأَمَّا بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ فَحَدِّثْ
```

That is, tell people about the favors and blessings of Allah to you, for you talk about the blessings out of thanks for them. *Alousi* said:

> You were a poor and ignorant/lost orphan. Then Allah took care of you, guided you and enriched you. Therefore, don't forget the blessings of Allah upon you in these three ways: Be gentle with the orphan and be merciful with the beggar for you have tasted orphanhood and poverty. Guide the servants to the guided path as your Lord guided you.
