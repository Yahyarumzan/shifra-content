# Decoding Surah al Sharh

## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It talks about the noble rank of the messenger peace be upon him and his exalted rank with Allah most High. Indeed, the discussion is about the numerous blessings of Allah upon His messenger and servant *Muhammad*, peace be upon him, such as the expansion of his chest with belief, the illumination of his heart with wisdom and perception and his purification from sins and burdens. The purpose of these reminders is to console and soothe the messenger of Allah when he faced hardship from the lying disbelievers for his noble sake with the lights that Allah most High blessed him (Verses 1-3)

Then, it talks about the raising of the rank of the messenger, peace be upon him, in this life and the next as he connected his name, peace be upon him, with the name of Allah most High (Verse 4)

The chapter then describes the calling of the messenger, peace be upon him, while he was in *Makkah* with the believers and the suffering from the opposition of the disbelieving liars and hardship therein, consoling him with the proximity of relief and victory upon his enemies. (Verses 5-6)

The chapter concludes with a reminder to *Mustafa*, peace be upon him, regarding the duty to focus on worshipping Allah after finishing to spread the message and gratitude to Allah for the exalted blessings bestowed upon him. (Verses 7-8)

## Explanation

```
94:1 أَلَمْ نَشْرَحْ لَكَ صَدْرَكَ
```

The use of the question particle `أَ` here is for emphasis and repetition. That is, have we not expanded your breast, O *Muhammad* with guidance and belief, the light of the *Koran* as Allah most High says in the Koran (6:125):

```
6:125 فَمَن يُرِدِ اللّهُ أَن يَهْدِيَهُ يَشْرَحْ صَدْرَهُ لِلإِسْلاَمِ
```

> And whomsoever God wills to guide, his chest He opens wide with willingness towards self-surrender [unto Him]

Ibn Kathir said:

> That is, we have illuminated him and rendered him wide and ample as Allah expanded his breast. Similarly, He has made the rules for him wide, kind and easy so that he does not leave and does not feel confined.

Abu Hiyan said:

> The expansion of his chest indicates illumination with guidance, his expansion by the reception and acceptance of what was inspired to him

This is also what the majority of scholars say. It was said (related by *ibn Abbas*)

> It is the opening of his chest by *Jibril* while he was young

```
94:2 وَوَضَعْنَا عَنكَ وِزْرَكَ
```

That is, we have removed from you a heavy burden or weight

```
94:3 ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنقَضَ ظَهْرَكَ
```

That is, that burdened and weakened your back. The scholars of *tafsir* said:

> The use of the word burden points to the works that undertook the prophet, *peace be upon him* and removal means forgiveness for him as Allah most High said:

```
48:2 لِيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ
```

> That Allah may forgive thee thy faults of the past and those to follow; fulfil His favour to thee;
and guide thee on the Straight Way

> It does not point to forgiveness for sins since the messengers are protected from disgusting offenses but for what he, _peace be upon him_, did out of his interpretation and he was blamed for in situations such as the permission he gave to the hypocrites for staying away from _jihad_ when they exceeded their bounds and took redemption from difficulty at the battle of _Badr_. He was frowned upon for lack of insight. It was said in _Tashil_ that when the sins or wrongdoings of the prophets are described as burden, they refer to the small forgiven actions that distress them and that they are distressed by. They are described as burden because of the strength of their fear of God as mentioned in the following tradition:

> Verily, the believer sees his sins like a mountain about to collapse on him while the hypocrit sees his sins like a fly flying on his nose

Regarding the uttered sound, `أَنقَضَ`, it is what is heard from a loaded beast such as the back of a camel from the heaviness of the weight.

We have raised your affair in the world and the next and we have connected your name with Our Name. `Mujahid` said (that the prophet said):

> I am not remembered except that you are remembered with me.

`Qatada` said:

> God has raised his remembrance in this world and the next. There is no preacher, or listener, or praying person who says or calls "There is not God but God" that he includes with it "Verily Muhammad is God's messenger".

In a narration,

> Jibril came to me and told me: O Muhammad,verily your Lord says: Would you like to know how I raised your remembrance? He replied: God knows best. If I am remembered, you are remembered with Me.

It was said in `Bahr`:

> God connected the remembrance of the messenger with His remembrance, most High, in the statement of belief, the call to prayer, the call to standing for prayer, in the `tashahud`, in the sermon and in several parts of the Koran, obligated the prophets and their people to believe in him (peace be upon him) as was said by _Hasan bin Thabit_:

> His Lord has joined His Name to the name of the prophet (peace be upon him)

That is, after oppression comes victory and after hardship comes ease and relief. The scholars said:

> The messenger of God (peace be upon him) and his companions in `Mecca` faced hardship and oppression due to the harm of the disbelievers to the prophet and the believers. God promised him ease just like He enumerated the blessings bestowed upon him at the beginning of this chapter as consolation for him, as a cure for his sadness and strengthen his hope.

God Most High said:

> Verily the one who has bestowed upon you this amazing blessing, He will grant you victory over difficulty and make your actions clear. He will exchange this difficulty with a forthcoming ease. Hence, it is repeated for the sake of eloquence with the next verse.

That is, victory will come after hardship and ease after difficulty. Therefore, do not be sad or displeased. In a narration, it is mentioned:

That is, O `Muhammad` (peace be upon you), when you have finished calling people to God, exert yourself in the worship of the Creator. When you have finished with the affairs of this world, tire yourself with the pursuit of the next world.

That is, care and long for what is with God, not what is in this ephemeral world. Ibn Kathir said:

> The meaning is when you have tired yourself with the affairs of this world, seperate yourself from it, exhaust yourself with worship and stand actively in it with an attentive mind, turning your intention and longing to your Lord.
