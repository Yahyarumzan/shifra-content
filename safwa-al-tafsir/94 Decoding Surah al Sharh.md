# Decoding Surah al Sharh

## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It talks about the noble rank of the messenger peace be upon him and his exalted rank with Allah most High. Indeed, the discussion is about the numerous blessings of Allah upon His messenger and servant *Muhammad*, peace be upon him, such as the expansion of his chest with belief, the illumination of his heart with wisdom and perception and his purification from sins and burdens. The purpose of these reminders is to console and soothe the messenger of Allah when he faced hardship from the lying disbelievers for his noble sake with the lights that Allah most High blessed him (Verses 1-3)

Then, it talks about the raising of the rank of the messenger, peace be upon him, in this life and the next as he connected his name, peace be upon him, with the name of Allah most High (Verse 4)

The chapter then describes the calling of the messenger, peace be upon him, while he was in *Makkah* with the believers and the suffering from the opposition of the disbelieving liars and hardship therein, consoling him with the proximity of relief and victory upon his enemies. (Verses 5-6)

The chapter concludes with a reminder to *Mustafa*, peace be upon him, regarding the duty to focus on worshipping Allah after finishing to spread the message and gratitude to Allah for the exalted blessings bestowed upon him. (Verses 7-8)

## Explanation

```
94:1 أَلَمْ نَشْرَحْ لَكَ صَدْرَكَ
```

The use of the question particle `أَ` here is for emphasis and repetition. That is, have we not expanded your breast, O *Muhammad* with guidance and belief, the light of the *Koran* as Allah most High says in the Koran (6:125):

```
6:125 فَمَن يُرِدِ اللّهُ أَن يَهْدِيَهُ يَشْرَحْ صَدْرَهُ لِلإِسْلاَمِ
```

> And whomsoever God wills to guide, his chest He opens wide with willingness towards self-surrender [unto Him]

Ibn Kathir said:

> That is, we have illuminated him and rendered him wide and ample as Allah expanded his breast. Similarly, He has made the rules for him wide, kind and easy so that he does not leave and does not feel confined.

Abu Hiyan said:

> The expansion of his chest indicates illumination with guidance, his expansion by the reception and acceptance of what was inspired to him

This is also what the majority of scholars say. It was said (related by *ibn Abbas*)

> It is the opening of his chest by *Jibril* while he was young

```
94:2 وَوَضَعْنَا عَنكَ وِزْرَكَ
```

That is, we have removed from you a heavy burden or weight

```
94:3 ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنقَضَ ظَهْرَكَ
```

That is, that burdened and weakened your back. The scholars of *tafsir* said:

> The use of the word burden points to the works that undertook the prophet, *peace be upon him* and removal means forgiveness for him as Allah most High said:

```
48:2 لِيَغْفِرَ لَكَ اللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ
```

> So that God might show His forgiveness of all thy faults, past as well as future

> It does not point to forgiveness for sins for the messengers are protected from disgusting offenses but for what he, *peace be upon him*, did out of his interpretation and he was blamed for it such as the permission he gave to the hypocrites for not going for *jihad*
