# Decoding Surah al Humazah

## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It talks about those people who find fault in others and destroy them with signs that criticize and lessen, as well as through scorring, mockery and ridicule. All of these are done by the foolish. (Verses 1-2)

These slanderers are engaged in gathering and amassing wealth as if they will abide in this world forever. They think, by their ignorance and forgetfulness, that wealth will last forever in this world. (Verse 3)

The chapter closes with the remembrance of the outcome of these miserable and wretched people. Indeed, they will stay forever in a fire that never goes out, a fire that will break the criminals and all those that encounter it from people, into pieces. Verily, `الحطمة` is the fire of Hell! (Verses 4-9)

## Explanation

```
104:1  وَيْلٌ لِّكُلِّ هُمَزَةٍ لُّمَزَةٍ
```

A dire punishment, ruin and destruction for all those who accuse and discredit people regarding their reputation and defame them in secret through winking and eyebrows. The scholars of tafsir said:

This chapter was revealed regarding `الأخنس بن شريق` who was involved with many incidents concerning people where he slandered and defamed them, whether in front of them or in their back. However, this is a general ruling and advice for all people and does not apply only to the situation and person surrounding the revelation.

```
104:2 ٱلَّذِى جَمَعَ مَالًا وَعَدَّدَهُۥ
```

Those that gather wealth in large quantity and are always checking the amounts and do not want it to diminish so that it stops them from doing good. *Al Qurtubi* said:

```
104:3 يَحْسَبُ أَنَّ مَالَهُۥٓ أَخْلَدَهُۥ
```

They believe due to ignorance from their negligence, that their wealth will last forever in this world.

```
104:4 كَلَّا ۖ لَيُنۢبَذَنَّ فِى ٱلْحُطَمَةِ
```

They will be prevented from this belief. By Allah, they will be thrown in the fire that shatters and devours everything that it encounters.

```
104:5 وَمَآ أَدْرَىٰكَ مَا ٱلْحُطَمَةُ
```

Magnitication and intensification of this affair: what is it that will be told about the reality of this blazing fire? Indeed, it shatters bones and consumes meat until it forces itself in hearts. Then, it is explained further by:

```
104:6 نَارُ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْمُوقَدَةُ
```

It is the burning fire of Allah that burns by His Command and Will. It is not like flammes from sorcery for it never goes out. In a hadith narration, it is reported:

> It is thrown in the fire for one thousand years until it becomes red. Then it is thrown in for another one thousand years until it becomes white. Finally, it is thrown in for another one thousand years until it becomes black. In it is a tenebrous blackness.

```
104:7 ٱلَّتِى تَطَّلِعُ عَلَى ٱلْأَفْـِٔدَةِ
```

It inflicts pain and ache to the hearts until it consumes them. *Qurtubi* said:

> The hearts are specifically mentioned because if the pain reaches the heart, it's owner dies. They are in the state of death but they cannot die as Allah most High said:

```
87:13 ثُمَّ لَا يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلَا يَحْيَى
```

So, for them, when they live, it is in the state of death.

```
104:8 إِنَّهَا عَلَيْهِم مُّؤْصَدَةٌ
```

Verily, the doors of Hell are forever closed for them. No soul will enter upon them.

```
104:9 فِى عَمَدٍ مُّمَدَّدَةٍۭ
```

They will be tied in chains and shackles, whereby the grip on their hands and feet will intensify after the gates of Hell have closed on them. They will be prevented from leaving by the superposed layers of the gates upon them and it will never end.
