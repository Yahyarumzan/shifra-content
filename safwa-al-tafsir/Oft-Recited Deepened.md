Similar to a physical fitness training plan where it is important to complete each step before proceeding to the next, completing each action point in this guide before moving on to the next section is the way to obtaining maximum benefit.

## Source

The main source of the explanations is from the book [`صفوة التفاسير` (Safwa al Tafasir)](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B5%D9%81%D9%88%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B1#:~:text=%D8%B5%D9%81%D9%88%D8%A9%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B1%20%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8%20%D9%81%D9%8A%20%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85,%D8%A3%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%20%D8%A3%D8%A6%D9%85%D8%A9%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%8C%20%D8%A8%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A8%20%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%B1), written in Arabic by one of the contemporary masters of Koranic exegesis, [`محمد علي الصابوني` (Muhammad Ali Al Sabouni)](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF_%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%8A_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%86%D9%8A) (may God most High have mercy on his soul) where he summarised the meanings of all major works of Koranic exegesis in two volumes.

## Pre-requisites

In order to make the most of this guide, it is recommended that you are able to:

- Read and recite Koranic Arabic correctly and fluently for chapters 93 to 114 of the Koran (By learning and practicing the rules of tajwid with a qualified teacher such as with [Kiflayn](https://kiflayn.com/product/one-on-one-tajweed-level-2-the-juz-amma/) or [Qasidonline](https://qasidonline.com/product/tajweed-pronunciation/)).

## Chapter One: The Glorious Morning Light

### Overview

Chapter 93 of the holy Koran (Al-Duha or the glorious morning light) was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It talks about the character of the greatest prophet (ﷺ) and the blessings that God most High bestowed upon him in this world and the next so that he could thank Him through these blessings.

Verses 1-3: The chapter begins with an oath connected to the loftiness of the magnitude of the prophet (ﷺ). Verily, his Lord has not abandoned him and does not hate him as the disbelievers claim. On the contrary, his destiny, place and affair are elevated in the eyes of God most High.

Verses 4-5: Then, it brings the good news of numerous rewards for the prophet (ﷺ) in the next life, including a type of miracle, namely the great intercession.

Verses 6-8: Thereafter, it reminds him of his state when he was a child, how he was an orphan, poor, needy and lost. Then, his Lord sheltered him, enriched him and took care of him. 

Verses 9-11: It concludes with advice in three commands that juxtapose to the three blessings mentioned previously. These commands are: 

- being favourably disposed to orphans.
- being merciful to the needy.
- consoling the tears of the miserable.

It closes with order and symmetry using the beauty of the Arabic language with a magnificent proclamation of originality and loftiness.

### Reason for revelation

The prophet of God (ﷺ) complained, for he did not stand for night prayer for two or three nights, because he did not receive any revelation on these days. Then, a woman came, Umm Jamil, the wife of Abu Lahab and she said, « O Muhammad, verily your devil did not come back and he has left you! I have not seen him around you for two or three nights. »

Then, God most High sent verses 1 to 3 of Al-Duha as a reply to the disbelievers.

#### Action Point: Listen with purpose and feeling

With the overview in mind, listen to the chapter Al-Duha in Arabic as many times as needed until you can:

- Identify the main sections described in the overview.
- Imagine the context of the revelation.
- Feel the commands apply to you.

### Explanation of the Verses

#### Verses 1 and 2: The oaths

```javascript
وَٱلضُّحَىٰ وَٱلَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَىٰ
```

God most High swears by the time of mid-morning which happens after the sun has risen and by the night when its darkness has increased and everything has been covered by it. Ibn Kathir explains that the oath of God most High by the mid-morning is related to what makes it shine and that second oath by the night is when everything calms down due to darkness. These moments of the day point to the power of God most High.

#### Action Point: Read with Meaning and reflect

Read verses 1 and 2 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. Reflect on the beauty and grandeur of these two moments that God swears by.

#### Verse 3: God has not left you

```
مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ وَمَا قَلَىٰ
```

O Muhammad (ﷺ), your Lord has not left you because He has chosen you and He does not hate you because He loves you. This is the reply to the disbelievers when they said, « Your Lord has left you.» And it is the answer to the oaths in verses 1 and 2.

#### Verse 4: The next world is better for you

```
وَلَلْـَٔاخِرَةُ خَيْرٌ لَّكَ مِنَ ٱلْأُولَىٰ
```

The abode of the next life is better for you, O Muhammad (ﷺ) than the life of this world because the next life is eternal whilst this world is finite and this is why the righteous say, « O God, there is no life except the life of the next world. »

#### Action Point: Read with meaning and reflection

Read verses 3 and 4 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. Reflect on the comfort that God is bringing to the prophet (ﷺ) and the reminder of the after life in relation to your own times of difficulty.

#### Verse 5: He has given you plenty of rewards

```
وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَىٰٓ
```

Your Lord shall give you in the next life many rewards, among which are miraculous happenings, mainly in the shape of intercession so that you will be completely content. Ibn Abbas said, « this intercession is for his people until he his content.  ». It was narrated that verily the prophet (ﷺ) remembered his people and said:

> « O God, my people, my people », and cried. So God said « O Jibril, go to Muhammad and ask him why he is crying ». Verily God already knows why. Then, Jibril went to the prophet (ﷺ) and asked him so that the prophet (ﷺ) informed him why. Then, God said « O Jibril, go to Muhammad and tell him that We will satisfy you with your people, so don't grieve. »

The following narration further explains, « there is for each prophet, special requests that are guaranteed to be answered. Hence, all prophets hasten to ask. Verily, I have concealed your asking for your people until the day of judgement. »

In another narration, Khazin said: 

> « First, a sign was placed upon his back, certainly comprising the good of this world and the next with it. So God gave him victory in this world through victory upon his enemies, a lot of following, many openings and the most elevated of religions. He made his people the best of people and gave him in the next world, general intercession and a praised rank, in addition to more good in this world and the next. »

#### Action Point: Read with meaning and reflection

Read verse 5 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. Reflect on the rewards promised to the prophet and ask with depth of heart for the intercession by the prophet on that day.

#### Verse 6: You were an orphan

```
أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيمًا فَـَٔاوَىٰ
```

Were you not, O Muhammad, an orphan in your youth and God protected you with your uncle Abu Talib and put you under his care? Ibn Kathir said: 

> « His father passed away whilst his mother was still pregnant of him. Then, his mother passed away whilst he was six years old. Then he was in the care of his grandfather, Abdul Mutalib and the latter passed away whilst he was eight years old. Then, he was cared for by his uncle Abu Talib so that protection and victory did not leave him. He was raised by God's power until God sent him the message whilst Abu Talib was worshipping the idols like his people. Thereafter, hardship followed the prophet (ﷺ) and all of this was from God's protection and out of care for him.

#### Verse 7: You were lost

```
وَوَجَدَكَ ضَآلًّا فَهَدَىٰ
```

Did we not find you stray from the knowledge of the religion and it's rules, then we guided you unto it. As God says in verse 52 of chapter 42 of the Koran:

```
مَا كُنتَ تَدْرِى مَا ٱلْكِتَـٰبُ وَلَا ٱلْإِيمَـٰنُ وَلَـٰكِن جَعَلْنَـٰهُ نُورًا نَّهْدِى بِهِۦ مَن نَّشَآءُ مِنْ عِبَادِنَا
```

Translated by Yusuf Ali, « thou knewest not (before) what was Revelation, and what was Faith; but We have made the (Qur'an) a Light, wherewith We guide such of Our servants as We will. »

Imam Al Jalil said: « That is, we found you ignorant related to what you did not know at the time about the rules of religion and then we guided you upon it. » Furthermore, it was said: « He was lost in the outskirts of Makkah whilst he was young and God guided him back to his grandfather. » Abu Hiyan said: « It is not befitting to say that he was guided after being ignorant as prophets are protected from this. » Ibn Abbas said: « This ignorance refers back to whilst he was lost in Makkah when he was young. » It is said: « He was lost whilst he was with his uncle on the way to Sham. »

#### Verse 8: You were poor

```
وَوَجَدَكَ عَآئِلًا فَأَغْنَىٰ
```

We found you poor and needy and we enriched you in the world such as we facilitated for you the means of trade. 

#### Action Point: Read with meaning and reflection

Read verses 6, 7 & 8 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. Reflect on these 3 blessings bestowed to the prophet with respect to many similar blessings that God has bestowed upon you.

#### Verse 9: Care for the orphan

```
فَأَمَّا ٱلْيَتِيمَ فَلَا تَقْهَرْ
```

That is, do not scorn or degrade the orphan, and don't take his wealth. Mujahid said: « Don't despise him. » Sufian said: « Don't wrong him by wasting his wealth. » In other words, be with the orphan as a merciful father, for you were an orphan and God protected you.

#### Verse 10: Care for the beggar

```
وَأَمَّا ٱلسَّآئِلَ فَلَا تَنْهَرْ
```

Regarding the beggar who is asking out of need and poverty, don't drive him away when he asks. Don't speak rudely to him. Give him or reply to him with a beautiful speech. Qatadah said: « Reply to the poor with kindness and softness. »

#### Verse 11: Share your blessings

```
وَأَمَّا بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ فَحَدِّثْ
```

Tell people about the blessings of God upon you, with the intention of sharing the feeling of gratefulness. Alousi said, « you were a poor and lost orphan. Then God took care of you, guided you and enriched you. Therefore, do not forget the blessings of God upon you in these three ways: 

- Be gentle with the orphan
- Be merciful with the beggar for you have tasted orphanhood and poverty
- Guide the people to the guided path as your Lord guided you

#### Action Point: Read with meaning and reflection

Read verses 9, 10 & 11 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. Reflect on these 3 commands to the prophet with respect to how you can also apply them in your life.

## Chapter Two: The Expansion of the Breast

### Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). 

Verses 1-3: It talks about the noble and exalted rank of the messenger (ﷺ) with God most High and about the numerous blessings bestowed by God upon His messenger Muhammad (ﷺ) such as the expansion of his chest with belief, the illumination of his heart with wisdom and perception and his purification from sins and burdens. The purpose of these reminders is to console and soothe him when he faced hardship from the lying disbelievers (Verses 1-3).

Verse 4: Then, it talks about the raising of the rank of the messenger (ﷺ) in this life and the next as God connected His name (ﷺ) with the messenger’s name.

Verses 5-6: The chapter then describes the calling to Islam by the messenger (ﷺ) with the believers while he was in Makkah and the suffering from the opposition of the disbelievers together with the hardship therein, consoling him with the proximity of relief and victory upon his enemies.

Verses 7-8: The chapter concludes with a reminder to Mustafa (ﷺ) regarding the duty to focus on worshipping God when he has completed spreading the message as well as having gratitude to God for the exalted blessings bestowed upon him.

#### Action Point: Listen with focus and feeling

With the overview in mind, listen to the chapter Al-Sharh in Arabic as many times as needed until you can:

- Identify the main sections described in the overview.
- Feel the blessings that God has bestowed to you and visualize yourself remembering them in times of hardship.

### Explanation of the Verses

#### Verse 1: The expansion

```
 أَلَمْ نَشْرَحْ لَكَ صَدْرَكَ
```

The use of the question particle `أَ` here is for emphasis and repetition. The verse asks, « have we not expanded your breast, O Muhammad with guidance, belief and the light of the Koran » as God most High says in verse 125 of chapter 6:

```
فَمَن يُرِدِ ٱللَّهُ أَن يَهْدِيَهُۥ يَشْرَحْ صَدْرَهُۥ لِلْإِسْلَـٰمِ
```

Translated by Yusuf Ali, « Those whom Allah (in His plan) willeth to guide, He openeth their breast to Islam ».

Ibn Kathir said, « In other words, we have illuminated him and rendered him with a largesse of character with God’s expansion of his breast. Similarly, He has made the rules for him wide, kind and easy so that he does not leave the religion and does not feel restricted. » In the same vein, Abu Hiyan said, « the expansion of his chest indicates illumination with guidance and the reception and acceptance of what was inspired to him ». While this is the main opinion of scholars regarding the meaning of this verse, we can find a narration related by ibn Abbas, « it is the opening of his chest by Jibril when he was young. »

#### Verse 2: Removed a burden

```
وَوَضَعْنَا عَنكَ وِزْرَكَ
```

This verse says that God (We) has removed from you, Muhammad (ﷺ), a heavy burden or weight.

#### Verse 3: A heavy burden

```
ٱلَّذِىٓ أَنقَضَ ظَهْرَكَ
```

Here, the verse refers to the weight mentionned in the previous verse and describes it as burdening and weakening your (Muhammad’s (ﷺ)) back.

The scholars of Koranic exegesis said, « the use of the word burden points to the mission that  the prophet (ﷺ) undertook and removal means forgiveness for him as God most High said: »

```
لِّيَغْفِرَ لَكَ ٱللَّهُ مَا تَقَدَّمَ مِن ذَنۢبِكَ وَمَا تَأَخَّرَ وَيُتِمَّ نِعْمَتَهُۥ عَلَيْكَ وَيَهْدِيَكَ صِرَٰطًا 
مُّسْتَقِيمًا
```

Translated by Yusuf Ali, « That Allah may forgive thee thy faults of the past and those to follow; fulfil His favour to thee; and guide thee on the Straight Way »

It does not point to forgiveness for sins since the messengers are protected from committing offenses but for what he (ﷺ) did out of his interpretation and was blamed for in situations such as the permission he gave to the hypocrites for staying away from jihad when they exceeded their bounds and chose redemption from difficulty at the battle of Badr. He was frowned upon for his lack of insight. It was said in Tashil that when the sins or wrongdoings of the prophets are described as burden, they refer to the small forgiven actions that distress them. They are described as burden because of the strength of their fear of God as mentioned in the following tradition:

> « Verily, the believer sees his sins like a mountain about to collapse on him while the hypocrit sees his sins like a fly flying around his nose. »

The uttered sound (`أَنقَضَ`) is what is uttered from a beast of burden like a camel when it is loaded with a heavy weight.

#### Action Point: Read with meaning and reflection

Read verses 1, 2 and 3 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. Reflect on a time when you faced a difficulty and how you felt when the difficulty went away.

#### Verse 4: Raised by remembrance

```
وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ
```

The meaning of this verse is that We (God) have raised your affair in this world and the next and We have connected your name with Our Name (God’s name). Mujahid[^1] said that the prophet (ﷺ) said:

> « I am not remembered except that you are remembered with me. »

Qatada[^2] said:

> « God has raised his (Muhammad’s) remembrance in this world and the next. There is no preacher, or listener, or praying person who says or calls, there is not God but God, except that he includes with it, verily Muhammad (ﷺ) is God's messenger. »

In a narration, it is reported that Muhammad (ﷺ) said,

> « Jibril came to me and told me: « O Muhammad, verily your Lord says, « Would you like to know how I raised your remembrance? » He replied, « God knows best. » Then Jibril said that God said: « If I am remembered, you are remembered with Me. » »

It was said in Bahr, « God connected the remembrance of the messenger (ﷺ) with His remembrance, most High, in the statement of belief, the call to prayer, the call to standing for prayer, the tashahud, the sermon and several parts of the Koran. He made it incumbent on the prophets and their people to believe in him (ﷺ) as was said by Hasan bin Thabit, « His Lord has joined His Name to the name of the prophet (ﷺ). » »

#### Action Point: Read with meaning and engage your heart

Read verse 4 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. Pronounce the testification of faith and the blessing on the prophet (ﷺ) several times slowly, reflecting on it and letting it soothe your heart until you feel peace.

#### Verse 5: With Hardship Comes Ease

```
فَإِنَّ مَعَ ٱلْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا
```

This verse means that after oppression comes victory and after hardship comes ease and relief. The scholars said, « the messenger of God (ﷺ) and his companions in Mecca faced hardship and oppression from the disbelievers. God fulfills the promise for ease by starting the chapter with a consolation, a cure for his sadness and a strenghthening of his hope through the enumeration of the blessings bestowed upon him. »

God Most High said, « verily the one who has bestowed upon you this amazing blessing, He will grant you victory over difficulty and make your actions clear. He will exchange this difficulty with a forthcoming ease. » Hence, it is repeated for the sake of eloquence with the next verse.

#### Verse 6: With hardship comes ease

```
إِنَّ مَعَ ٱلْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا
```

This verse explains that victory will come after hardship and ease after difficulty. Therefore, do not be sad or displeased. In a narration, it is mentioned, « one does not overcome difficulty except with two acts of ease. »

#### Action Point: Read with meaning and reflection

Read verses 5 and 6 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. Reflect on times of hardship in your own life and the relief after.

#### Verse 7: Exert yourself

```
فَإِذَا فَرَغْتَ فَٱنصَبْ
```

In this verse, God says, O Muhammad (ﷺ), when you have finished calling people to God, exert yourself in the worship of the Creator. In other words, when you have finished with the affairs of this world, tire yourself with the pursuit of the next world.

#### Verse 8: Turn your attention

```
وَإِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ فَٱرْغَب
```

Here, God asks Muhammad (ﷺ) to long for what is with God but not what is in this ephemeral world. Ibn Kathir said, « the meaning of this verse is that when you have tired yourself with the affairs of this world, seperate yourself from it, exhaust yourself with worship and stand actively in it with an attentive mind, focusing your intention and longing to your Lord. »

#### Action Point: Read with meaning and pray with dedication

Read verses 7 and 8 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. Make a plan to stand up in night prayer and dedicate your attention to God alone during the prayer.

## Chapter Three: The Fig

### Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It talks about two main topics:

- The honor of God most High to humankind.
- The belief in retribution and reward.

Verses 1-3: The chapter begins with God swearing by the sanctified Beqaa valley ([region to the east of Lebanon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beqaa_Valley)) and other honorable places that God most High has favoured with the descent of revelation to the prophets and messengers. These are Jerusalem, the moutain of Tur and the blessed Mecca, by which God most High swears by and has honored man with.

Verses 4-5: Then, splendid proofs are presented that point to the power of the Lord of the worlds, namely the creation of man in the best shape and most beautiful form. If he is not grateful with the blessings of his Lord, he will be thrown down to the lowest level of hellfire. The disbelievers rebuked by refusing to accept resurrection.

Verses 7-8: The chapter closes with a clear statement by God with the reward of the believers and the punishment of the disbelievers. In this declaration, the method of emphasis with questioning is used to enhance the reader’s realisation of requital and reward in the hereafter and reproach for disbelief by the deniers of the judgement day.

#### Action Point: Listen with focus and feeling

With the overview in mind, listen to the chapter Al-Tin in Arabic as many times as needed until you can:

- Identify the main sections described in the overview.
- Feel the favours that God has bestowed upon you through the creation of fruits and trees in your surroundings.

### Explanation of the Verses

#### Verse 1: The place of the fig and the olive 

```
وَٱلتِّينِ وَٱلزَّيْتُونِ
```

God swears by the fig and the olive due to the blessing in them and their beneficial use. Ibn Abas said: « It is our fig that we eat and our olive that we press to extract oil. » Ikrima said: « God swears by the place of the fig and the olive. Indeed, the fig grows abundantly in Damascus and the olive in Jerusalem. » The latter is a clearer or stronger meaning. Verily, this points to the fact that God most High is pointing to the well known places of the mountain of Tur and the safe city. Therefore, His oath is by these honorable places that He has enobled with revelation from the heavens.

#### Verse 2: The mountain of Tur

```
وَطُورِ سِينِينَ
```

Here, God swears by the blessed mountain where He talked to the prophet Musa and this is the Tur Sinai where many trees grow and blessings abound.

Khisan said, « it was named Sinain and Sinai by it's excellence and blessedness. All mountains where fruitful trees grows are named Sinain and Sinai. »

#### Verse 3: The city of Mecca

```
وَهَـٰذَا ٱلْبَلَدِ ٱلْأَمِينِ
```

Then, God swears by the safe city, Mecca, where the person and the wealth of anyone who enters, are safeguarded as God most High says:

```
أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا۟ أَنَّا جَعَلْنَا حَرَمًا ءَامِنًا وَيُتَخَطَّفُ ٱلنَّاسُ مِنْ حَوْلِهِمْ
```

Yusuf Ali translated, « Do they not then see that We have made a sanctuary secure, and that men are being snatched away from all around them? »

Alusi said, « this oath is by the blessed place, distinguished by those who passed on it frequently. Without any doubt, it refers to the blessed Mecca that God protects. Regarding Tur Sinai, it refers to the mountain where God spoke to Musa. »

Furthermore, regarding Tur Sinai, the fig and the olive, Qatadah related that this points to two mountains, namely Damascus and Jerusalem. The reference to the fig and the olive goes back to their land of origin. Another opinion says, « the purpose behind these two (fig and olive) are the famous trees. » This is also the opinion of Ibn Abas and Mujahid.

The goal with the oath by these elements of creation is to expose the nobleness of these blessed places and what appears in them of good and blessings with the prophets and messengers.

Ibn Kathir said, « some of the imams concluded that they are three places. God sent in all of them prophets, transmitting the message with strong determination and applying the highest of laws. The first one is the place of the fig and the olive which is Jerusalem where God most High sent prophet Isa (may God bestow peace upon him). The second one is Tur Sinai where God most High spoke to prophet Musa (may God bestow peace upon him), son of Imran. The third one is the safe city where anyone who enters is safeguarded. It is the place where God most High sent Muhammad (ﷺ). At the end of the Tawrah, these three places are mentioned, first when God came to the mountain of Sinai to speak to Musa (may God bestow peace upon him). Then, it turns to the east with the mountain of Jerusalem where God sent the prophet Isa (may God bestow peace upon him). Thereafter, it discloses the mountain of Faran ([Desert of Paran, also spelled Pharan or Faran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_of_Paran)), referring to the mountain of Mecca where God sent Muhammad (ﷺ). They are remembered in the order of the passage of time. First, God swears by the most honorable (Tur Sinai) compared to all other places, and then the more honorable related to the first (Jerusalem) and then the most honorable from all of them (Mecca).

The answer to the oath comes in the next verse.

#### Action Point: Read with meaning, research and visualise 

Read verses 1, 2 and 3 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. Research and read about the three blessed places. If you have the means, travel to them if you have not already done so.  As you read, try to visualize and project yourself to each place. 

#### Verse 4: The best of creatures

```
لَقَدْ خَلَقْنَا ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ فِىٓ أَحْسَنِ تَقْوِيمٍ
```

This verse mentions that We (God) created humankind from the best of form, exemplified through the most beautiful and complete of characteristics, including the beauty of form, the capability of standing and the symmetry of physiology graced by knowledge, understanding, intelligence, distinction, articulated speech and manners.

Mujahid said, « `أَحْسَنِ تَقْوِيمٍ` means the best of shape or form, that is, the best of creation »

#### Verse 5: The lowest of the low

```
ثُمَّ رَدَدْنَـٰهُ أَسْفَلَ سَـٰفِلِينَ
```

Then, God threw him in the lowest level, for not doing what he was created for by not being grateful for the blessings God created for him such as him being in the best of form. He does not use the benefits that God allocated to him to worship God. Therefore, God will send him in the lowest of the low which is the hellfire. Mujahid and Hassan said, « `أسفل سافلين` means the lowest degree of hellfire. » Dahak said, « in other words, we threw him in a humiliating state, which is old age after youth and weakness after strength. »

Alusi said, « we extract from the context the state of the disbeliever on judgement day. Indeed, he will be in the most odious and ugliest of forms after he was in the best of forms. »

#### Verse 6: The righteous believers

```
إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ فَلَهُمْ أَجْرٌ غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ
```

The verse says, except the godfearing believers who combine belief with righteous works. For them, there is an unending reward which is paradise for the godfearing.

#### Action Point: Read with meaning and reflect 

Read verses 4, 5 and 6 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. Reflect and wonder on man’s creation from such a tiny element and upon the numerous blessed characteristics that are endowed to him in this creation process. Can you feel ungrateful after that? Can you feel that what you have is from your own making? Feel content with the eternal reward promised to the believers who act upon their belief with righteous works.

#### Verse 7: Take heed

```
فَمَا يُكَذِّبُكَ بَعْدُ بِٱلدِّينِ
```

The verse asks in a rhetorical fashion, what is it that inclines you towards the denial of judgement day after this proof. The takeaway for people is the path of taking heed. O mankind, what is the reason for denial after this advice and the clarity of the proofs? He (God) created man from a drop or sperm and perfected him in the most beautiful of forms. This is the clearest proof of the power of God most High and the existence of resurrection and retribution.

#### Verse 8: Who is the final judge?

```
أَلَيْسَ ٱللَّهُ بِأَحْكَمِ ٱلْحَـٰكِمِينَ
```

This verse asks a rhetorical question: Is not God, the creator, who is the most just, in judgement and ruling, deciding between the servants? 

In a narration, it is mentioned:

> « When the prophet (ﷺ) used to read this verse, he used to say, « Of course, He (God) is and I am a witness to it. » »

#### Action Point: Read with meaning and plan to take heed

Read verses 7 and 8 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. Make a plan to keep yourself in watch to stay away from the actions that God dislikes.

## Chapter Four: The Clot

### Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It contains 19 verses. It is also known as the chapter « Read » and talks about the following topics:

- The beginning of revelation to the last prophet *Muhammad* (ﷺ).
- The oppression of mankind through wealth and the disobience to the commands of God most High.
- The wretched forelock of Abu Jahl and his prohibition of the prophet (ﷺ) to pray and practice the revelation.

Verses 1-5: The chapter begins with the explanation of the special favour of God to the blessed messenger by the miraculous descent of the Koran to him. It starts with the first blessing whilst he was worshipping his Lord in the cave of Hira. The revelation then descended upon him through the wise words of the Koran.

Verses 6-8: Then, it talks about the oppression of mankind in this world through the blessings of strength and wealth when they make him disobey or revolt against the commands of his Lord. What is incumbent upon him is to be grateful to his Lord for these blessings, and not to deny their source. It then reminds him of the return to his Lord for retribution.

Verses 9-10: Thereafter, it discusses the wretched forelock of Abu Jahl, the pharoah of this generation who used to threaten and intimidate the messenger (ﷺ) and prevent him from praying in order to bring victory to the idols and statues.

Verses 11-19: The chapter closes with a threat by God to this wretched disbeliever with a strong punishment if he continues to oppress the noble messenger (ﷺ) by restraining the latter from praying.

While the chapter begins with the call to reading and learning, it ends with prayer and worship in an attempt to connect knowledge with action. It balances the beginning with the end in the most eloquent way.

### Reason for revelation

Muslim reported in his sahih collection that:

> Abu Jahl, the cursed, said one day to his companions, « does Muhammad (ﷺ) rub his face in the dust when he is around you? Does he try to pray and prostrate amongst you. » They replied in the affirmative. Then, he said, « by Al Lat and Al Uzza, if I see him pray like this, I will step on his head and surely rub his face in the dust. » One day, he came and found the messenger of God (ﷺ) praying. He came close in order to step on his head but suddenly, he stepped back on his heels and raised his hands in protection. The onlookers were surprised and asked him, « what is the matter with you? » He responded, « verily, between me and him, was a trench of fire. It was also around him and to his sides. » Then, the messenger of God (ﷺ) said, « Had he approached me, the angels would have seized him by his limbs. »

Then, God most High sent the verses 9 to 18 of this chapter.

### Explanation of the Verses

#### Verse 1: Read

```
 ٱقْرَأْ بِٱسْمِ رَبِّكَ ٱلَّذِى خَلَقَ
```

This is the first word from the divine speech given to the prophet (ﷺ) and the beginning of Koranic revelation. It contains an invitation to read, write and pursue knowledge as they are characteristics of the religion of Islam. The verse means, O Muhammad, read the koran by beginning with the name of your sublime Lord who created all creatures and has provided all knowledge.

In the next verse, God explains creation emphatically with the creation of mankind.

#### Verse 2: The Clot

```
خَلَقَ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ
```

This verse explains that He (God) has created this unique form of mankind, the noblest amongst all creations, from a blood clot or leech. Modern medicine acknowledges that semen or sperm, from which mankind is created, contains animals and small worms invisible to the naked eye. When you look at them using a microscope, you recognise that they have heads and tails such that they are called the spermatic animals. Al Qurtubi said, « He (God) distinguished mankind with a special remembrance for him. `العلقة` is a portion of something that is damp. It is named as such because it clings and becomes moist from what goes through to it. »

#### Verse 3: Your generous Lord

```
ٱقْرَأْ وَرَبُّكَ ٱلْأَكْرَمُ
```

Here, the verse says, read O Muhammad by your sublime and generous Lord, the unequaled one whose generosity has no match. Indeed, it points to the perfection of His generosity for He taught the servants what they did not know about Him from different types of knowledge and attributes.

#### Verses 4 and 5: God taught using the pen

```
ٱلَّذِى عَلَّمَ بِٱلْقَلَمِ
عَلَّمَ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ
```

This verses explains that He (God) taught penmanship and writing with the pen and taught man what he did not know about God, taking him from the darkness of ignorance to the light of knowledge. Furthermore, God, most sublime, taught men to arbitrate with each other using writing with the pen to establish rules and regulations. Qurtubi said, « God most High raised him with the favour of the knowledge of the pen, in which are tremendous benefits that mankind has not encompassed and without which knowledge could not have been recorded, sayings could not have been written down and history could not have been preserved. Furthermore, God's revelation was kept only by writing without which there would have been no soundness in the affairs of the world and the religion. »

These five verses are the first to have descended from the Koran to the seal of the prophets and messengers as established by this sahih report:

> « An angel descended to the prophet (ﷺ) while he was in seclusion in the cave of Hira, and said: « Read. » Then, he said, « I cannot read. » (Until the end of the chapter)
>

Ibn Kathir said, « the first thing that was sent from the Koran are these blessed verses and they are the first mercy of the Most Merciful to His servants. In them is an indication of the beginning of mankind's creation from a blood clot. They come from His generosity for He taught mankind what he does not know and honored him with knowledge. He is the Power who distinguished Adam from the angels. »

Then, God most High warns people of the arrogance and oppression of mankind with the next verse.

#### Action Point: Read with meaning, research and reflect.

Read verses 1 to 5 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at them. Research about the stages of the formation of the embryo in the womb and reflect on the blessing of the pen with which knowledge is preserved and transmitted so that humankind can develop a corpus of beneficial knowledge. 

#### Verse 6: Oppression of the self

```
كَلَّآ إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ لَيَطْغَىٰٓ
```

The meaning of this verse is that verily, mankind goes beyond the limit in oppressing himself by the intensification of the desires of the self and the arrogance towards his Lord most High.

#### Verse 7: He sees richness from himself

```
أَن رَّءَاهُ ٱسْتَغْنَىٰٓ
```

Because he sees himself rich when he becomes wealthy and shows arrogance. Then, God threatens him and brings him down in the next verse.

#### Verse 8: Your final outcome

```
إِنَّ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ ٱلرُّجْعَىٰٓ
```

O mankind, you will return to your Lord and your outcome will be with Him. Therefore, your success is with your works. In this verse is a threat and warning to mankind towards the reckoning for immorality and oppression. From the next verse onwards, the warning extends to all common arrogant oppressors. The exegesis scholars said, « these verses (the current verse until the end of the chapter) were revealed because of Abu Jahl, a long time after the first part of the chapter came down. Abu Jahl was an oppressor due to his abundance of wealth and he did his utmost to oppose the messenger (ﷺ) and admonish him publicly without any specific reason. »

#### Action Point: Read with meaning, reflect and plan.

Read verses 6 to 8 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at them. Reflect on your own life, on a time when you obtained a goodly reward from your hard work and how you felt good about your achievement. Did you remember God at this moment or did you feel it was all from you? Set a plan to train yourself to remember your Lord and praise Him deeply in your heart the next time you receive a goodly reward.

#### Verses 9 and 10: Have you seen him do that wicked action? 

```
أَرَءَيْتَ ٱلَّذِى يَنْهَىٰ
عَبْدًا إِذَا صَلَّىٰٓ
```

Here, attention is brought to the state of this insolent wrongdoer. God says, « Have you seen, O Muhammad, the state of this wicked wrongdoer who prevents a servant from worshipping his Lord through prayer. He is certainly foolish and performs a very disgraceful act. » Abu Saud said, « the style of these verses reflect the state of the oppressor and denounce it. The goal is to create astonishment in the reader. »

The scholars of exegesis agreed that verily, the praying servant, is Muhammad (ﷺ) and that the preventer is the damned Abu Jahl as the latter said, « if I saw Muhammad pray, I would trample on this neck. »

#### Verse 11: You are stopping a truly guided prophet!

```
أَرَءَيْتَ إِن كَانَ عَلَى ٱلْهُدَىٰٓ
```

This verse is now talking to Abu Jahl with the meaning, « Don’t you know that this praying servant whom you are preventing from a guided and righteous prayer, is the prophet (ﷺ). He is upon the straight path in his sayings and actions. »

#### Verse 12: His action is sincere

```
أَوْ أَمَرَ بِٱلتَّقْوَىٰٓ
```

Here, it continues with, « Don’t you know that his action is sincere and directed, calling upon guidance and integrity. How can you rebuke and prevent him? ». What is more shocking than this? 

#### Verse 13: He opposes belief

```
أَرَءَيْتَ إِن كَذَّبَ وَتَوَلَّىٰٓ
```

Then, the chapter returns the speech or address to the messenger (ﷺ) by saying, « Have you seen, O Muhammad, that he refutes the koran and turns away from belief. »

#### Verse 14: Does he not know that God sees him?

```
أَلَمْ يَعْلَم بِأَنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَرَىٰ
```

This verse continues to address Muhammad (ﷺ) by asking, « does this villain not know that verily God is aware of these happenings, that He sees all his actions and will requite him for them. Woe to him, who is very ignorant and shortsighted. »

#### Verse 15: If you do not stop...

```
كَلَّا لَئِن لَّمْ يَنتَهِ لَنَسْفَعًۢا بِٱلنَّاصِيَةِ
```

Then, God prevented him (Abu Jahl) and held him back as it was said with a threat, « if he does not stop harming the messenger and refrain from doing what he is doing out of ignorance and disbelief, I (God) will prevent Abu Jahl from his transgression and error. »

The second part of the verse means, « We will take him from his frontal lobe, drag him to the fire with vigor and strength and cast him in it. »

#### Verse 16: The liar who is mistaken

```
نَاصِيَةٍ كَـٰذِبَةٍ خَاطِئَةٍ
```

The owner of this forelock is a liar, an insolent with a lot of crimes. It was said in tashil, « it is described with lie and error metaphorically. The liar and wrongdoer are in essence companions. The wrongdoer is the one who commits crimes intentionally while the mistaken is the one who commits crimes without a purpose. »

#### Verse 17: Let him call for help

```
فَلْيَدْعُ نَادِيَهُۥ
```

Let him call upon the people of his tribe and his associates for help and assistance.

#### Verse 18: We will call the angels of hellfire

```
سَنَدْعُ ٱلزَّبَانِيَةَ
```

We will call from the depths of hellfire the harsh and powerful angels.

It was related that Abu Jahl crossed paths with the prophet (ﷺ) while he was praying around the Kaba. He said « Have I not warned you about this, O Muhammad! » Then, the messenger of God (ﷺ) was upset with him. Abu Jahl said, « By what thing do you threaten me, O Muhammad! By God, verily, no tribe is larger than this tribe. By God, neither you nor your Lord can do anything to me. » Then, God sent verses 17 and 18

Ibn Abbas said, « if he had called his tribe, the angels of hell would have certainly seized him instantly »

#### Verse 19: Do not obey him!

```
كَلَّا لَا تُطِعْهُ وَٱسْجُدْ وَٱقْتَرِب ۩
```

This insolent will be stopped, so do not obey him O Muhammad in what he is calling you to do by leaving the prayer. Persevere in your prostration and your prayer so that you come closer to your Lord. It is reported in a narration:

>  The servant is closest to his Lord when he is prostrating. Therefore, supplicate much and often.

#### Action Point: Read with meaning and imagine...

Read verses 9 to 19 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at them. Imagine that you are an onlooker and picture the situation of Abu Jahl entering the Kaba and going to the prophet (ﷺ). As you read the verses going through the chronology of the events, feel the emphatic movement as the focus of the person being addressed constantly switches between Muhammad (ﷺ) and Abu Jahl.

## Chapter Five: The Power

### Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It talks about the beginning of the revelation of the mighty koran which happened during the night of power. It shows the distinctiveness of this night upon the remainder of the days and months due to what can be found in it of lights, sacred revelations and divine gifts that God most High benefits the devotee with. Furthermore, it talks about the descent, until the appearance of dawn, of the devoted angels who have been granted this special night of al Qadr which is for God, better than one thousand months.

### Explanation

#### Verse 1: The descent of the koran

```
إِنَّآ أَنزَلْنَـٰهُ فِى لَيْلَةِ ٱلْقَدْرِ
```

We have revealed to you, O Muhammad, this miraculous koran in the noble night of power. The exegesis scholars say, « it is named the night of power due to its sublimeness, its power and its nobleness. »

The process of the descent of the koran was from the preserved tablet to the sky of this world. Thereafter, Jibril descended with it to the earth over a period of twenty three years. Ibn Abbas said:

> God revealed the Koran in one whole from the preserved tablet to the house of Uzzah through the sky of the world. Then, it was revealed in parts according to the events over twenty three years to the messenger of God (ﷺ)

#### Verse 2: What is the night of power?

```
وَمَآ أَدْرَىٰكَ مَا لَيْلَةُ ٱلْقَدْرِ
```

Here, the verse is set as a question for exaltation and amplification due to its power by asking, « what have We informed you regarding the noble night of power? » Khazin said, « the path of exaltation for it (the night of power) and creating a longing for knowing about it. »

#### Action Point: Read with meaning and ask with wonderment

Read verses 1 to 2 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at them. Just as it is emphatically done in the second verse, ponder and wonder in amazement about the greatness of this night in relation to the descent of the Koran.

#### Verse 3: Better than one thousand months

```
لَيْلَةُ ٱلْقَدْرِ خَيْرٌ مِّنْ أَلْفِ شَهْرٍ
```

The night of power in its degree and nobleness is better than worshipping for one thousand months because of the exceptional event of the blessed descent of the noble Koran. The exegesis scholars say, « righteous works done on the night of power are better than one thousand months of good works outside of the night of power. »

It was narrated:

> Verily, a man wore a weapon and fought in God's path for one thousand months so that the messenger of God (ﷺ) and his companions were amazed and the messenger of God (ﷺ) wished by saying, « O my Lord, you made my people with the shortest lifespan so that their works are the least. » Then, God gave the night of power and said, « the night of power is better for you and your people than the fighting of this man for one thousand months. »
>

Mujahid said, « the works, fasting and standing in it are better than one thousand months. »

#### Verse 4: The angels descend

```
تَنَزَّلُ ٱلْمَلَـٰٓئِكَةُ وَٱلرُّوحُ فِيهَا بِإِذْنِ رَبِّهِم مِّن كُلِّ أَمْرٍ
```

The angels and Jibril descend to the earth during this night by the command of their Lord to execute God's decree for the upcoming year. 

#### Verse 5: The serenity

```
سَلَـٰمٌ هِىَ حَتَّىٰ مَطْلَعِ ٱلْفَجْرِ
```

God places serenity from the beginning of this day at dawn to the rising of the sun as the angels greet the believers. God decrees only goodness and peace to mankind at this time.

#### Action Point: Read with meaning, reflect and plan to be part of it

Read verses 3 to 5 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at them. Reflect on the three blessings of the night of power with the multiplication of rewards, the descent of angels and the complete serenity before sunrise. Plan to spend regular time in focused worship during the last ten days of Ramadhan with the hope of catching the night of power.

## Chapter Six: The Clear Proof

### Overview

This chapter was revealed after the emigration to Medina (`مدنية`) and it is also known as the chapter of `لم يكن`. It discusses the following points:

- The station of the people of the book in the message of Muhammad (ﷺ).
- The topic of sincerity in worship to God most High.
- The outcome of everyone, whether blissful or miserable, in the after life.

Verse 1-3: This blessed chapter talks about the position of the Jews and the Christians when it comes to the message of the prophet (ﷺ) after their waiting for his arrival. When he came to them with light, they were the first one who rejected the message. 

Verses 4-5: Then, the chapter talks about one of the important components of belief, namely sincerity of worship for God most High who made it incumbent upon the people of all religions. He also asked to make Him unique, most Elevated, in remembrance and purpose and to turn to Him in all sayings, actions and works, for Him alone, the Beneficent. (Verse 4-5)

Verses 6-8: Thereafter, it talks about the outcome of the wrongdoers, the evil of creation, related to the people of the book and the disbelievers and their eternal abode in hellfire. It also talks about the outcome of the believers, owners of a high rank (the good of creation) and their eternal abode in the blissful garden with the prophets, the truthful, the martyrs and the righteous, as a reward for their obedience and sincerity to the Lord of the worlds.

### Explanation

#### Verse 1: The people of disbelief

```
 لَمْ يَكُنِ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ وَٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ مُنفَكِّينَ حَتَّىٰ تَأْتِيَهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَةُ
```

The people of disbelief and denial, who disbelieve in God and His messenger, are defined[^3] as the Jews, Christians (the people of the book) and the disbelievers who worship idols. They will not cease their path of disbelief until a clear proof comes to them, which is the appearance of Muhammad (ﷺ) as explained in the next verse.

#### Verse 2: The appearance of the message

```
رَسُولٌ مِّنَ ٱللَّهِ يَتْلُوا۟ صُحُفًا مُّطَهَّرَةً
```

This clear proof is the message of Muhammad (ﷺ), sent from God most High, as pages devoid of falsehood that he reads to them. He reads by heart because he is an illiterate prophet (ﷺ) who cannot read nor write. Qurtubi said, « He reads from the writing of the pages by heart, not by reading the words, as he (ﷺ) was illiterate. »

Ibn Abbas said, « `مطهرة` means free from falsehood, doubt, hyprocrisy and error. »

Qatada said, « Free from falsehood. »

#### Verse 3: Writings of truth

```
فِيهَا كُتُبٌ قَيِّمَةٌ
```

Here the verse continues by saying, « in it are truthful rules and commands without any crookedness that separate truth from falsehood. » Sawi said, « the purpose of pages of sheets of paper or leaves is for the writing of the Koran with its rules. The use of `فيها كتبٌ قيمة` is because the Koran includes the benefits of the previous writings sent by God. »

Then, God most High reminds us of who disbelieves, namely the people of the book with the next verse.

#### Verse 4: They differed after a clear proof

```
وَمَا تَفَرَّقَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ إِلَّا مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَتْهُمُ ٱلْبَيِّنَةُ
```

The Jews and the Christians did not differ regarding the matter of Muhammad (ﷺ) except after a clear proof came to them, an evidence of the truthfulness of the message for the messenger was promised to them in their books. Abu Saud said, « the intended purpose is to expose the mistaken offense of the people of the book by stating that they did not separate except after the truth was made clear to them and the situation was shown so that they separated with excuses as God says (3:19):

```
إِنَّ ٱلدِّينَ عِندَ ٱللَّهِ ٱلْإِسْلَـٰمُ ۗ وَمَا ٱخْتَلَفَ ٱلَّذِينَ أُوتُوا۟ ٱلْكِتَـٰبَ إِلَّا مِنۢ بَعْدِ مَا جَآءَهُمُ ٱلْعِلْمُ بَغْيًۢا بَيْنَهُمْ ۗ وَمَن يَكْفُرْ بِـَٔايَـٰتِ ٱللَّهِ فَإِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَرِيعُ ٱلْحِسَابِ
```

Translated by Yusuf Ali: « The Religion before Allah is Islam (submission to His Will): Nor did the People of the Book dissent therefrom except through envy of each other, after knowledge had come to them. But if any deny the Signs of Allah, Allah is swift in calling to account. » »

It was said in Tashil, « they did not differ regarding the prophethood of Muhammad (ﷺ) except after they knew that it was true. This reminder identifies the people of the book because they know the truthfulness of prophethood from what came in their books. »

#### Action Point: Read with meaning and reflect

Read verses 1 to 4 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. Reflect on the reason why the people of the book did not accept Muhammad (ﷺ) as the messenger although it was clearly mentioned in their holy scriptures and they were waiting for him? Was it because he was not from their people? Extending this to our own lives, do we only perform acts of worship or follow God’s commands when we like or want to do it?

#### Verse 5: This is the complete religion

```
وَمَآ أُمِرُوٓا۟ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مُخْلِصِينَ لَهُ ٱلدِّينَ حُنَفَآءَ وَيُقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَيُؤْتُوا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ ۚ وَذَٰلِكَ دِينُ ٱلْقَيِّمَةِ
```

In the first part of the verse, it explains that it is only commanded in the Torah or the Injil for them to worship God alone. However they inclined to something else and worshipped their religious people (bishops and rabbis) and their monks as God most High said (9:31):

```
ٱتَّخَذُوٓا۟ أَحْبَارَهُمْ وَرُهْبَـٰنَهُمْ أَرْبَابًا مِّن دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْمَسِيحَ ٱبْنَ مَرْيَمَ وَمَآ أُمِرُوٓا۟ إِلَّا لِيَعْبُدُوٓا۟ إِلَـٰهًا وَٰحِدًا ۖ لَّآ إِلَـٰهَ إِلَّا هُوَ ۚ سُبْحَـٰنَهُۥ عَمَّا يُشْرِكُونَ
```

Translated by Yusuf Ali: « They take their priests and their anchorites to be their lords in derogation of Allah, and (they take as their Lord) Christ the son of Mary; yet they were commanded to worship but One Allah: there is no god but He. Praise and glory to Him: (Far is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him). »

`حنفاء`: All religions were inclined towards the religion of Islam. It is aligned with the religion of Ibrahim and was revealed to the seal of messengers.

The second part of the verse defines the religion as being commanded to perform the prayer by turning completely towards a specific direction, in appointed times, with conditions, tranquility and manners, and to give the alms to those entitled as a cure for the self. Sawi said, « special focus is given to prayer and alms due to the possible misguidance in performing them »

The third part of the verse is like a question to the people of the book: Why do they not enter into the religion of Islam when it includes sincerity of worship, prayer and giving the alms?

Then, God most High reminds us of the return for the pious and the sinners in the abode of retribution.

#### Action Point: Read with meaning and reflect

Read verse 5 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. Reflect on Islam being a balanced religion by combining purity of heart with external  worship and alms giving for societal contribution.

#### Verse 6: The abode of the deniers of the truth

```
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا۟ مِنْ أَهْلِ ٱلْكِتَـٰبِ وَٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ فِى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ خَـٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ ۚ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ هُمْ شَرُّ ٱلْبَرِيَّةِ
```

Verily, they are those who lie about the Koran and the prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) from the Jews, the Christians and the idol worshippers. All of them will be in hellfire on judgement day where they will reside foreever and they will never come out from. Imam Fakhar said, « It was said: Why is the word reject or hide `كفروا` used as a verb and the word disbelievers `والمشركين` used as a verbal noun? The answer is that it is a warning that the people of the book were not disbelievers when the command first came as they believed in the Torah and the Injil. Thereafter, with the appearance of Muhammad (ﷺ), they rejected him in relation to his conflict with the disbelievers so that they were brought forth as idol worshippers and deniers of the judgement day. »

They removed from their book the page about Muhammad (ﷺ) so that their people would not realize their evil lies.

Right after God has mentioned the station of the damned, He talks about the station of the felicitous.

#### Verses 7 and 8: The abode of the believers

```
إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّـٰلِحَـٰتِ أُو۟لَـٰٓئِكَ هُمْ خَيْرُ ٱلْبَرِيَّةِ
جَزَآؤُهُمْ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ جَنَّـٰتُ عَدْنٍ تَجْرِى مِن تَحْتِهَا ٱلْأَنْهَـٰرُ خَـٰلِدِينَ فِيهَآ أَبَدًا ۖ رَّضِىَ ٱللَّهُ عَنْهُمْ وَرَضُوا۟ عَنْهُ ۚ ذَٰلِكَ لِمَنْ خَشِىَ رَبَّهُۥ
```

Verily, the believers are those who join between belief and righteous works. They are the best of creatures that God created. Based on what they committed to belief and righteous works, their reward in the after life is elevated gardens and castles in which they will reside forever and below which the rivers of paradise flow. They will not die, nor will they leave and they will be in felicity forever. God will be pleased with them from the worship and righteous works that they committed to in this world and they will be pleased with Him by the good and honors He bestowed upon them. This goodly reward is for whoever fears God, is wary of Him and refrains any sin for the sake his Lord.

#### Action Point: Read with meaning, take heed and visualise

Read verses 6 to 8 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. Reflect upon the arrogance of the people of the book in rejecting the message of Muhammad (ﷺ) because he was not from their people and take heed to not fall in the same trap in your own life. Read more about the punishment of people in the hellfire and internalise it to protect yourself. Similarly, reflect on the righteous actions of the believers and make a plan to perform regular righteous works. Read more about the rewards of the believers in paradise and internalise them to keep your focus.

## Chapter Seven: The Earthquake

### Overview

This chapter was revealed after the emigration to Medina (`مدنية`). It's style is similar to the chapters revealed before the emigration (`مكية`) in that it talks about the calamities of the day of judgement, namely the violent earthquakes that will occur in the last hour, destroy all the tall edifices and drive away all deeply rooted mountains. Strange and extraordinary things will happen that will dismay people such as the removal of the dead from the earth, the casting out of what is inside it such as precious treasures of gold and silver and its testimony of everything that people did upon it by saying, « You did this and this on this day ».

These are from the extraordinary things that will happen on this dreadful day like it was recounted regarding the departure of creatures from the squeezed earth to paradise or hell and their divisions into two groups, one who will be happy and one who will be miserable as God says in verse 7 of chapter 42 of the Koran:

```
وَكَذَٰلِكَ أَوْحَيْنَآ إِلَيْكَ قُرْءَانًا عَرَبِيًّا لِّتُنذِرَ أُمَّ ٱلْقُرَىٰ وَمَنْ حَوْلَهَا وَتُنذِرَ يَوْمَ ٱلْجَمْعِ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ ۚ فَرِيقٌ فِى ٱلْجَنَّةِ وَفَرِيقٌ فِى ٱلسَّعِيرِ
```

Translated by Yusuf Ali, « Thus have We sent by inspiration to thee an Arabic Qur'an: that thou mayest warn the Mother of Cities and all around her,- and warn (them) of the Day of Assembly, of which there is no doubt: (when) some will be in the Garden, and some in the Blazing Fire. »

### Explanation

#### Verse 1: The terrible shaking

```
إِذَا زُلْزِلَتِ ٱلْأَرْضُ زِلْزَالَهَا
```

If the earth was moved violently such that earthquakes shake vigorously and everything on top of it is shaken to the point that hearts are disrupted and their core is terrified like God says (22:1):

```
يَـٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلنَّاسُ ٱتَّقُوا۟ رَبَّكُمْ ۚ إِنَّ زَلْزَلَةَ ٱلسَّاعَةِ شَىْءٌ عَظِيمٌ
```

Translated by Yusuf Ali: « O mankind! fear your Lord! for the convulsion of the Hour (of Judgment) will be a thing terrible! »

The scholars of Koranic exegesis say, « when the earthquake is ordained upon it, it's affair will be terrifying as it is said: « This will happen at the last hour. It will shake consecutively and will upset what is upon it. It will not cease until it will find in its womb mountains, trees, buildings and ships. » »

#### Verse 2: The earth expels her burden 

```
وَأَخْرَجَتِ ٱلْأَرْضُ أَثْقَالَهَا
```

The earth will expell what is in its womb such as treasures and dead bodies. Ibn Abbas said, « It will expell its dead bodies. »

Mundhir bin Saeed said, « it will expell its treasures and dead bodies. »

It is mentioned in a narration (Sahih Muslim 1013):

> The earth will vomit the hidden treasures from within it like things made out of gold and silver. Then the murderer will come and say, « It was for this (treasure) that I killed. » Then, the breaker of family ties will come and say, « It was for this (treasure) that I broke the ties of kinship. » Then, the robber will come and say, « It was for this (treasure) that my hands were cut off. » Then, they will leave it (treasure) and they will not take anything from it.

#### Verse 3: What is the matter with her?

```
وَقَالَ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنُ مَا لَهَا
```

Mankind said: « What is happening to the earth so that it shakes with this terrible earthquake and it expels what is inside it. He says this with surprise and is perplexed by this terrible state. »

#### Action Point: Read with meaning and feel the shaking

Read verses 1 to 3 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. If you have not experienced an earthquake before (may God protect us), read about them so that you can imagine and feel what it would be like if an earthquake happened near you. Then, imagine experiencing this continuously with much greater magnitude. How would you feel like? Would you utter the same words mentioned in verse 3?

#### Verse 4: She will recount everything she saw

```
يَوْمَئِذٍ تُحَدِّثُ أَخْبَارَهَا
```

On this crucial day, the last day, the earth will recount what was done upon it of good and evil and it will be a witness to all of mankind about what he did upon its back.

Abu Hurairah said:

> The prophet (ﷺ) read (this verse) and said, « Are you aware of what it will apprise mankind of? » They said: « God and the messenger know best. » He said: « Verily, it will apprise every person of their actions it witnessed upon its back and will say, « He did this on that day and that on that day, and so on and so forth. » »
>

In another narration, it is said:

> You are all safeguarded by the earth for it is your mother. It is aware of every single good or evil act done upon it. 

#### Verse 5: Inspired by God

```
بِأَنَّ رَبَّكَ أَوْحَىٰ لَهَا
```

These tidings will be revealed by the earth because God most dignified will command it to do so and He will permit it to articulate everything that happened upon it. It will complain about the sinner and be a witness against him and it will be thankful for the obedient person and praise him. There is nothing extraordinary about this because God most High has power over all things.

#### Action Point: Read with meaning and reflect over the miracle of the earth

Read verses 4 and 5 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. Reflect on the organic and dynamic nature of the earth, one of the huge blessings of creation that harbours the growth of plants. If God has already facilitated for the earth such amazing characteristics, is it not easy for Him to make it a witness of every action of humankind?

#### Verse 6: Man will see what he did

```
يَوْمَئِذٍ يَصْدُرُ ٱلنَّاسُ أَشْتَاتًا لِّيُرَوْا۟ أَعْمَـٰلَهُمْ
```

On this day, the creatures will return to a state of reckoning. They will depart scattered, group by group and the people of the right will attain paradise whilst the people of the left will descend to hellfire. They will accept the result of their actions, may it be good or bad.

#### Verse 7: Man will see his smallest good deed

```
فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْرًا يَرَهُۥ
```

Whoever did a small amount (equivalent to the weight of a dust particle) of good, he will find it in his book on the last day and he will find his reward for it. Al Kilabi said, « `الذرة` is smaller than an ant »

Ibn Abbas said, « when your account is shown on the earth, it will be lifted ... »

#### Verse 8: Man will see his smallest evil deed

```
وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرًّا يَرَهُۥ
```

Whoever did a small amount of evil, equivalent to the weight of a dust particle, he will see it and suffer from the result of it. Qurtubi said: « This is as if God most High hit him for verily no action of the son of Adam is neglected, may it be small or big, as God says (4:40):

```
إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَظْلِمُ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ ۖ وَإِن تَكُ حَسَنَةً يُضَـٰعِفْهَا وَيُؤْتِ مِن لَّدُنْهُ أَجْرًا عَظِيمًا
```

Translated by Yusuf Ali: « Allah is never unjust in the least degree: If there is any good (done), He doubleth it, and giveth from His own presence a great reward. » »

#### Action Point: Read with meaning and be a witness

Read verses 6 and 8 in Arabic (closing your eyes if you have memorized them) until you can remember and review the explanation in your mind without looking at it. Reflect on how your actions would change if you knew that a camera constantly recorded all your actions from under your feet, that this camera cannot be destroyed and that it will play everything it recorded in front of you and your Lord. 

## Chapter Eight: The Steeds

### Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It talks about the strong breathing sound of the war horses when they are going forth with the attack of the enemies of Islam. They hit the stones with their hooves, striking fire and raise the dust. The chapter begins with God swearing by the war horses towards the state of man rejecting God being the source of blessings bestowed upon him. This oath makes it clear that these horses are honored in the sight of God. It is related to the magnitude and abundance of blessings which causes this strong rejection by what he says and his state as it explains the nature of man and his passion for wealth. The chapter ends with a reminder of the returning of all creatures to God with due retribution so that wealth will not benefit nor honor them in the hereafter but rather, belief and righteous works will!
