# Decoding Surah al Ma'un

## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It talks with succintness about two types of people:

- The disbelievers who deny the blessings of Allah and do not believe in the day of reckoning and recompense.
- The hypocrites who do not live with the knowledge of Allah in front of them and they pretend their works and prayers.

Regarding the first category, Allah most High reminds us of their blameworthy traits for they take little care of the orphans and rebuke them with harshness and no respect and do not do any good works even to the point of not reminding about the rights of the poor and needy. They do not act well in the worship of their Lord nor towards their fellow creatures. (Verses 1-3)

Regarding the second category, they are the hypocrites who are forgetful about their prayer and do not perform it in its time and stand for it with the external motions only and not with internal focus, only to show off in their works.

Both categories are promised woe and ruin, and they are made repulsive with ugliness by means of suprise and amazement through these types of actions. (Verses 4-7)

## Vocabulary

- `يدع`: Push away with violence and harshness. It was said: 

> Rebuff contemptuously, that is push away harshly.

Allah most High said: 

```
52:13 يَوْمَ يُدَعُّونَ إِلَى نَارِ جَهَنَّمَ دَعًّا
```

- `يحض`: urging and enticing
- `ساهون`: plural of `ساهي` - be distracted or absent-minded
- `الماعون`: small thing. The arabs say:

>  `ما له معنة ولا سعنة`

That is, so and so does not have neither little nor a lot of wealth. *Al Mubarid* and *Al Zagaj* said:

> It is anything that has a utility such as an axe, a saucepan, a bucket and so forth.

## Explanation

```
107:1 أَرَءَيْتَ ٱلَّذِى يُكَذِّبُ بِٱلدِّينِ
```

The questioning particle `أَ` used in order to arouse amazement and longing to find out. Do you know the one who disbelieves in the reward and reckoning in the next world? Do you know who he is and what his characteristics are? If you would like to know, then...

```
107:2 فَذَٰلِكَ ٱلَّذِى يَدُعُّ ٱلْيَتِيمَ
```

He is the one who pushes the orphan away with roughness and severity. He overcomes and oppresses him and does not give him his right.

```
107:3 وَلَا يَحُضُّ عَلَىٰ طَعَامِ ٱلْمِسْكِينِ
```

He does not urge towards feeding the poor. *Abu Hiyan* said:

> In the saying  `و لا يحض` is a pointer towards the fact that they do not feed even though they are able to. This is from the worst states of miserliness for not only they do not urge anyone but also, they advise others not to do so.

Razi said:

> Why was it said: `وَلَا يَحُضُّ عَلَىٰ طَعَامِ ٱلْمِسْكِينِ` and not `و لا يطعم المسكين`? The answer is that, since they prevent the orphans from getting their rights, how would they feed the poor from their own wealth? Furthermore, they are miserly about the wealth of others (by preventing others from feeding the poor) and this is the worst level of miserliness which is from the hardness of their heart and mean nature so that the result is that they don't feed the poor and do not command others to feed them because they disbelieve in the last day. If they believed in retribution, they would ascertain the reckoning and would not act like they do.

```
107:4 فَوَيْلٌ لِّلْمُصَلِّينَ
```

May ruin, destruction and punishment fall on the hypocrites who pray and are characterized by the repulsive traits that follow.

```
107:5 ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ عَن صَلَاتِهِمْ سَاهُونَ
```

Those who are forgetful about their prayers and delay their prayer until the time has passed. *Ibn Abas* said:

> This  refers to the people who pray but their prayer does not bring them any reward. If they leave it, they do not dread the resulting punishment.

*Abu Alia* said: 

> They do not pray in the required time, nor do they have tranquility in their bowing and prostration. 

Indeed, the messenger of Allah, *ﷺ* said about this verse:

> They are those who delay their prayers. 

The scholars of tafsir said:

> When Allah most High said: `عن صلاتهم ساهون` using the pronoun `عن`, it is known that it refers to the hypocrites. 

Hence, some from the righteous generations said:

> Praise be to Allah who said `عن صلاتهم` and did not say `في صلاتهم`. For it was said `في صلاتهم`, it would have included the believers for the believers are also sometimes forgetful in his prayer. The difference between these two types of forgetfulness is clear, for the forgetfulness of the hypocrite is that which brings him to leave the prayer altogether, and he does not remember to pray when he is busy. However, for the believers, if they are absent-minded in their prayer, they keep a watch for it and restore it by the prostration of forgetfulness.

Then, Allah most High adds one more blameworthy characteristic by saying:

```
107:6 ٱلَّذِينَ هُمْ يُرَآءُونَ
```

They pray in order to be seen by people so that people say that they are righteous. They have reverence so that it is said, they are fearful. They give in charity so that it is said, they are generous. Hence, reputation and showing off is what drives their actions.

```
107:7 وَيَمْنَعُونَ ٱلْمَاعُونَ
```

They prevent people from benefit and ease by not helping them with small things like axes, saucepans, salt, water and so on. In this verse, is rebuke for miserliness through these small and inconsiderable things for verily, miserliness in these is the worst level and this stems from lack of morality.
