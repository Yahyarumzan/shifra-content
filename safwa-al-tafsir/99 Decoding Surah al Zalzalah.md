# Decoding Surah al Zalzalah

## Overview

This chapter was revealed after the emigration to Medina (`مدنية`). It's way is similar to the chapters revealed before the emigration (`مكية`) in that it talks about the happenings and calamities of the day of judgement, namely the violent earthquakes that will occur in the last hour and destroy all the tall edifices and drive away all deeply rooted mountains. Strange and extraordinary things will happen that will dismay people such as the removal of the dead from the earth, the casting out of what is inside it such as precious treasures of gold and silver and its testimony of everything that people did upon it by saying:

> You did this and this on this day

All of this is from the extraordinary things that will happen on this dreadful day like it was recounted regarding the departure of creatures from the squeezed earth to paradise or hell and their divisions into two groups, one who will be happy and one who will be miserable as God says:

> 42:7

If the earth was moved violently such that earthquakes shake vigorously and everything on top of it is shaken to the point that hearts are disrupted and their core is terrified like God says (22:1):

> ٱتَّقُوا۟ رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّ زَلْزَلَةَ ٱلسَّاعَةِ شَىْءٌ عَظِيمٌ
>
> Be conscious of your Sustainer: for, verily the violent convulsion of the Last Hour will be an awesome thing! 

The scholars of koranic exegesis say:

> When the earthquake is ordained upon it, it's affair will be terrifying as it is said:
>
> > This will happen at the last hour. It will shake consecutively and will upset what is upon it. [] It will not cease until it will find in its womb mountains, trees, buildings and ships.
