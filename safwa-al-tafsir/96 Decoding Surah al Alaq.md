# Decoding Surah al Alaq

## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It contains 19 verses. It is named the chapter *Read* and talks about the following topics:

- The beginning of revelation to the last prophet *Muhammad* (ﷺ)
- The oppression of mankind by wealth and the disobience to the commands of God most High.
- The wretched forelock of *Abu Jahl* and his prohibition of the prophet (ﷺ) to pray and practice what was sent down of truth.

The chapter begins with the clarification of the special favour of God on the blessed messenger by the descent of this Koran, the everlasting miracle, to him. It starts with the first blessing whilst he was worshipping his Lord in the cave of *Hira*. The revelation then descended upon him through the lines of wise remembrance (verses 1-5)

Then, it talks about the oppression of mankind in this world with strength and fortune, such that it makes him disobey or revolt against the commands of his Lord due to the blessing of wealth. What was incumbent upon him was to be grateful to his Lord for these blessings, and not to deny them. It then reminds him of the return to his Lord for retribution and be taken into account (verses 6-8).

Thereafter, it discusses the wretched forelock of *Abu Jahl*, the Pharoah of this generation who used to threaten and intimidate the messenger and prevent him from praying, as victory for the idols and statues. (verses 9-10)

The chapter closes with the threat to this wretched disbeliever by stronger punishment if he continues on his straying and oppression like you ordered the noble messenger by the removal of attention to the threat of this wretched criminal. (verses 11-19)

While the chapter begins with the call to reading and learning, it ends with prayer and worship in an attempt to connect knowledge with action. It balances the beginning with the end in the most beautiful way with eloquence.

## Reason for revelation



Muslim reported in the *sahih* collection that Abu Jahl, the cursed, said one day to his companions:

> Does *Muhammad* rub his face in the dust when he is behind your backs? Does he want to pray and prostrate amongst you. 

They said:

> Yes

Then, he said:

> By *Al Lat* and *Al Uzza*, if I see him pray like this, I will step on his head and surely rub his face in the earth.

One day, he came and found the messenger of God (ﷺ) praying. He came close in order to step on his head but then, he surprised them as he withdrew on his heels and raised his hands in protection. Then they said to him:

> What is the matter with you?

He responded:

> Verily, between me and him is a trench of fire as well as around him and to his sides

Then, the messenger of God (ﷺ) said:

> Had he approached me, the angels would have seized by his limbs.

Then, God most High sent the verses 9 to 18.



## Explanation

<ShowVerses sura="96" ayahs={[1]}>

This is the first of divine speech sent to the prophet (ﷺ) and the beginning of the *koranic* revelation. It contains an invitation to reading, writing and puirsuit of knowledge as they are characteristics of the religion of *Islam*. It means:

> O *Muhammad*, read the koran by beginning with and using the name of your sublime Lord who created all creatures and has provided all knowledge

Then, He explains creation emphatically with the matter of mankind by saying:

</ShowVerses>

<ShowVerses sura="96" ayahs={[2]}>

That is, He has created this unique form of mankind, the noblest amongst all creations, from a blood clot or leech (this is a small leech or larvae). Modern medicine acknowledges that semen or sperm, from which mankind is created, contains animals and small worms invisible to the naked eye. When you look at them using a microscope, you recognise that they have heads and tails such that they are called the spermatic animals. So, blessed be to God, the best of creators.

*Al Qurtubi* said:

> He distinguished mankind with honored remembrance for him. `العلقة` is a portion of something that is damp. It is named as such because it clings and becomes moist from what passes to it

</ShowVerses>

<ShowVerses sura="96" ayahs={[3]}>

That is, read O *Muhammad* by your sublime and generous Lord, the unequaled one whose generosity has no match. Indeed, it points to the perfection of His generosity for He taught the servants what they did not know about Him from different types of knowledge and attributes

</ShowVerses>

<ShowVerses sura="96" ayahs={[4,5]}>

That is, He taught penmanship and writing with the pen and taught man what he did not know about Him, taking him from the darkness of ignorance to the light of knowledge. Furthermore, He, most sublime, taught men to mediate with each other with writing through the pen by teaching men without a mediator. Indeed, he was illiterate, not knowing to read and write. Qurtubi said:

> God most High raised him with the favor of the knowledge of the pen, in which are tremendous benefits that mankind has not encompassed and without which knowledge could not have been recorded, sayings could not have been written down and history could not have been preserved. Furthermore, God's revelation was kept only by writing without which there would have been no soundness in the affairs of the world and the religion. 

These first five verses are the first that descended from the koran to the seal of the prophets and messengers as established by this *sahih* report:

> An angel descended to the prophet (ﷺ) while he was in seclusion in the cave of *Hira*, and said:
>
> > Read
>
> Then, he said:
>
> > I cannot read
>
> (Until the end of the chapter)

*Ibn Kathir* said:

> The first thing that was sent from the koran are these blessed verses and they are the first mercy of the most Merciful to  His servants and the first blessing that God blessed them with. In them is an indication of the beginning of mankind's creation from a blood clot. Indeed, they are from His generosity for He taught mankind what he does not know, enobled and honored him with knowledge. He is the Power who distinguised *Adam* from the angels.

Then, God most High warns people due to the arrogrance and oppression of mankind by saying:

<ShowVerses sura="96" ayahs={[6]}>

Verily, mankind goes beyond the limit in the oppression, in the intensification of the desire of the self and in the arrogance towards his Lord most High.

Because he sees himself rich when he becomes wealthy and shows arrogance. Then, God threatens him and brings him down by saying:

<ShowVerses sura="96" ayahs={[8]}>

O mankind, you will return to your Lord and your outcome will be with Him. Therefore, your success is with your works. In this verse is a threat and warning to mankind towards the reckoning for immorality and oppression. From the next verse onwards, the warning extends to all common arrogant oppressors. The exegesis scholars said:

> These verses (the current verse until the end of the chapter) descended for *Abu Jahl* a long time after the moment when the first part of the chapter was revealed. *Abu Jahl* was an oppressor due to his abundance of wealth and he did his utmost to oppose the messenger (ﷺ) and admonish him publicly without any specific reason

<ShowVerses sura="96" ayahs={[9]}>

Attention is brought to the state of this insolent wrongdoer, in other words, spread the news, O *Muhammad*, about the state of this wicked wrongdoer who prevents a servant from worshipping his Lord through prayer. He has the most foolish mind and performs the most disgraceful action. *Abu Saud* said:

> These verses are ugly like the state of the oppressor and they denounce it. They are a plocamation due to the horridness of the state that needs to create astonishment. 

The scholars of exegesis agreed that verily, the praying servant, is *Muhammad* (ﷺ) and that the preventer is the damned *Abu Jahl* as he says:

> If I saw *Muhammad* pray, I would trample on this neck

<ShowVerses sura="96" ayahs={[10]}>

Or that his action was with sincerity and oneness, calling upon guidance and integrity. How can you rebuke and prevent him? What is more astonshing than this? Then, it returns the speech or address to the messenger (ﷺ) and says:

<ShowVerses sura="96" ayahs={[12]}>

<ShowVerses sura="96" ayahs={[13]}>

Does this villain not know that verily God is aware of these circumstances, is all seeing of his actions and will requite him for them. Woe to him, the most ignorant and stupid. Then, He prevented him and held him back as it was said:

</ShowVerses>

<ShowVerses sura="96" ayahs={[14]}>

He will prevent this insolent *Abu Jahl* from his transgression and error if by God, he does not stop harming the messenger and refrain from doing what he was doing out of ignorance and disbelief.

We will take him from his frontal lobe, drag him to the fire with vigor and strength and cast him in it.

</ShowVerses>

<ShowVerses sura="96" ayahs={[16]}>

The owner of this forelock is a liar, an insolent with a lot of crimes. It was said in *tashil*:

Then, the messenger of God (ﷺ) was upset with him. *Abu Jahl* said:

> By what thing do you threaten me, O *Muhammad*! By God, verily, no tribe is larger than this tribe. By God, neither you nor your Lord can do anything to me.

Then, God sent:
