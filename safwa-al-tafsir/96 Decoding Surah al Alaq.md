# Decoding Surah al Alaq

## Overview

This chapter was revealed before the emigration to Medina (`مكية`). It contains 19 verses. It is named the chapter *Read* and talks about the following topics:

- The beginning of revelation to the last prophet *Muhammad* (peace be upon him)
- The oppression of mankind by wealth and the disobience to the commands of God most High.
- The wretched forelock of *Abu Jahl* and his prohibition of the prophet (peace be upon him) to pray and practice what was sent down of truth.

The chapter begins with the clarification of the special favour of God on the blessed messenger by the descent of this Koran, the everlasting miracle, to him. It starts with the first blessing whilst he was worshipping his Lord in the cave of *Hira*. The revelation then descended upon him through the lines of wise remembrance (verses 1-5)

Then, it talks about the oppression of mankind in this world with strength and fortune, such that it makes him disobey or revolt against the commands of his Lord due to the blessing of wealth. What was incumbent upon him was to be grateful to his Lord for these blessings, and not to deny them. It then reminds him of the return to his Lord for retribution and be taken into account (verses 6-8).

Thereafter, it discusses the wretched forelock of *Abu Jahl*, the Pharoah of this generation who used to threaten and intimidate the messenger and prevent him from praying, as victory for the idols and statues. (verses 9-10)

The chapter closes with the threat to this wretched disbeliever by stronger punishment if he continues on his straying and oppression like you ordered the noble messenger by the removal of attention to the threat of this wretched criminal. (verses 11-19)

While the chapter begins with the call to reading and learning, it ends with prayer and worship in an attempt to connect knowledge with action. It balances the beginning with the end in the most beautiful way with eloquence.

## Reason for revelation



Muslim reported in the *sahih* collection that Abu Jahl, the cursed, said one day to his companions:

> Does *Muhammad* rub his face in the dust when he is behind your backs? Does he want to pray and prostrate amongst you. 

They said:

> Yes

Then, he said:

> By *Al Lat* and *Al Uzza*, if I see him pray like this, I will step on his head and surely rub his face in the earth.

One day, he came and found the messenger of God (peace be upon him) praying. He came close in order to step on his head but then, he surprised them as he withdrew on his heels and raised his hands in protection. Then they said to him:

> What is the matter with you?

He responded:

> Verily, between me and him is a trench of fire as well as around him and to his sides

Then, the messenger of God (peace be upon him) said:

> Had he approached me, the angels would have seized by his limbs.

Then, God most High sent the verses 9 to 18.
