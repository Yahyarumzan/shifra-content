# Prelude

In the winter of 2020, I started a weekly lesson with *sheikh Anas al Sibai*, an *Islamic* sciences teacher from [Homs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homs), Syria. We chose to go through the tafsir book, [صفوة التفاسير](https://ar.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D8%B5%D9%81%D9%88%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B1#:~:text=%D8%B5%D9%81%D9%88%D8%A9%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B1%20%D9%83%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A8%20%D9%81%D9%8A%20%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%85,%D8%A3%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%20%D8%A3%D8%A6%D9%85%D8%A9%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%8C%20%D8%A8%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%84%D9%88%D8%A8%20%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B3%D8%B1), by covering the chapters from Surah al *Duha* to Surah al *Nas*, as I have memorized these chapters and I recite them often in my daily prayers. My hope was to increase my focus and tranquility in my daily prayers by understanding the meaning at a deeper level. 

It has been over 6 months since I started these lessons and we have reached Surah al *Ma'un*. I have found tremendous benefits at the level of my prayer in relation to deeper meanings, focus and connection of heart. I feel the process that I have gone through had something to do with it, although I was not very assiduous in it. Another very important contribution was the mastery and depth of knowledge of my teacher, although I struggled sometimes to understand his Arabic.

In *Ramadan* 2021, I decided to write what we had covered in the lessons in English, not as a translation of the text, but more like an explanation of what I understood. As I was doing that, I felt that this content could benefit other people with a similar Arabic background experience as myself. After having a wonderful discussion with friend [Rebecca Cuevas](https://www.learnandgetsmarter.com/), she encouraged me to build an online self-paced course.

The content that I am writing in this repository will act as the **fuel** for this course.

## Course Goal

Given the chapters of the Koran from *Duha* to *Nas*, the Arabic text and audio, learners will be able to transform their reading and hearing of the verses in question to a deeply meaningful experience that connects them to God most High and His messenger, *ﷺ*.

## Approaches

1. Approach 1: How to course with the following steps:
   1. Remember the key vocabulary
   2. Understand the big ideas
   3. Apply these steps on a regular basis:
      1. Go through each verse, one at a time
      2. Recall the explanation of each verse as you are reading the verse
      3. Recite each verse out loud whilst reflecting on its meaning
      4. Reflect on the verses in your prayer and see how it feels
      5. Practice in your own prayer keeping these meanings in mind
   4. Refine your practice
2. Approach 2: How to and coaching course with following modules:
   1. Learn - same as Approach 1
   2. Practice:
      - Avoid these pitfalls
      - Establish your training plan
      - Get role models and accountability partners
      - Find your why
      - Get long term support
   3. Reflect
      - Are you looking forward to your prayer
      - How do you feel when you recite
      - How do you feel after your prayer

## Feedback

I'm looking for feedback on what approach above would be most suited for the aforementioned goal and/or other ideas/suggestions regarding the whole project.
