# Decoding Surah al Bayinnah

## Overview

This chapter was revealed after the emigration to Medina (`مدنية`) and it is also known as the chapter of `لم يكن`. It discusses the following points:

- The station of the people of the book in the message of *Muhammad* (ﷺ).
- The topic of sincerity in worship to God most High.
- The outcome of everyone, whether blissful or miserable, in the after life.

This blessed chapter talks about the position of the Jews and the Christians about the message of the prophet (ﷺ) after their waiting for his arrival. When he came to them with light, they were the first one who rejected the message. (Verse 1)

Then, the chapter talks about one of the important components of belief, namely sincerity of worship for God most High who made it incumbent upon the people of all religions. He also asked to make Him unique, most Elevated, in remembrance and purpose and to turn to Him in all sayings, actions and works, for Him alone, the Beneficent. (Verse 4-5)

Thereafter, it talks about the outcome of the wrongdoers, the evil of creation, related to the people of the book and the disbelievers and their eternal abode in hellfire.

## Explanation

<ShowVerses sura="98" ayahs={[1]}>

The people of disbelief and denial who disbelieve in God and His messenger, (the use of `من` in this context is `بيانية` which specifies what is being referred to) defined as the jews, christians (the people of the book) and the disbelievers who worship idols will not cease their path of disbelief until a clear proof comes to them, which is the appearance of *Muhammad* (ﷺ) as explained in the next verse

<ShowVerses sura="98" ayahs={[2]}>

This clear proof is the message of *Muhammad* (ﷺ), sent from God most High, as pages devoid of falseness that he reads to them. He reads by heart because he is an illiterate prophet (ﷺ) who cannot read nor write. *Qurtubi* said:

> He reads what is comprised in the writing of the pages by heart, not from the book, as he (ﷺ) was illiterate who did not know how to read nor write

*Ibn Abbas* said:

> `مطهرة` means free from falsehood, doubt, hyprocrisy and error.

*Qatada* said:

> Free from falsehood

In it are truthful rules and commands without any crookedness that separate truth from falsehood. *Sawi* said:

> The purpose of pages of sheets of paper or leaf is for writing of the koran and the written rules. It is mentioned `فيها كتبٌ قيمة` because the koran includes all the benefits of God's previous writings.

Then, God most High reminds us of  who disbelieves, namely the people of the book and He says:

<ShowVerses sura="98" ayahs={[4]}>

The jews and the christians did not differ regarding the matter of *Muhammad* (ﷺ) except after a clear proof came to them, an evidence of the truthfulness of the message for verily the messenger was promised to them in their books. *Abu Saud* said:

> The intended purpose is to expose the mistaken offense of the people of the book by stating that they did not separate except after the truth was made clear and the situation was shown so that they separated with excuses about the whole as God says:
>
> <ShowVerses sura="3" ayahs={[19]}/>

It was said in *Tashil*:

> They did not differ regarding the prophethood of *Muhammad* (ﷺ) except after they knew that it was true. This reminder identifies the people of the book because they they know the truthfulness of prophethood from what came in their books

<ShowVerses sura="98" ayahs={[5]}>

It is only commanded in the *torah* or the *injil* for them to worship God alone. However they inclined to something else and worshipped their religious people (bishops and rabbis) and their monks as God most High said:

<ShowVerses sura="9" ayahs={[31]}/>

`حنفاء`: All religions were inclined towards the religion of *Islam*, aligned with the religion of *Ibrahim*, true and authorized, that was revealed to the seal of messengers.

They were commanded to perform the prayer turning completely towards a specific direction, in appointed times, with conditions, tranquility and manners, and to give the alms to those entitled as a cure for the self. *Sawi* said:

> Special consideration is given to prayer and alms due to the harm in them both

With the elements of worship of sincerity, prayer and giving the alms being highlighted as constituting the correct religion, *Islam*, why do they not enter into it?

Then, God most High reminds us of the return for the pious and sinners in the abode of retribution.

<ShowVerses sura="98" ayahs={[6]}>

Verily, they are those who lie about the *koran* and the prophet *Muhammad* (ﷺ) from the jews, the christians and the idol worshippers. All of them will be in hellfire on judgement day, they will reside therein foreever, they will never come out from it and it will never end. They are the evildoers from creation. *Imam Fakhar* said:

> It was said: Why is the word reject or hide `كفروا` used as a verb and the word disbelievers `والمشركين` used as a verbal noun? The answer is that it is a warning that the people of the book were not disbelievers when the command first came as they believed in the *torah* and *injeel*. Thereafter, related to the appearance of *Muhammad* (ﷺ), they then rejected him around his conflict with the disbelievers so that they were brought forth as idol worshippers and deniers of the judgement day.
>

They removed from the book of God the page about *Muhammad* (ﷺ) so that their evil lies with sectioning the way of truth for the creatures.

Right after God has mentioned the station of the damned, He talks about the station of the felicitous

<ShowVerses sura="98" ayahs={[7]}>

Verily, the believers are those who join between belief and righteous works. They are the best of creatures that God created. Based on what they committed to belief and righteous works, their reward in the after life is elevated gardens and castles in which they will reside forever and below which the rivers of paradise flow. They will not die, nor will they leave and they will be in felicity forever. God is will be pleased with them from the worship and righteous works that they committed to in this world and they will be pleased with Him by the good and honors He bestowed upon them. This goodly reward is for whoever fears God, is wary of Him and stops any sin for his Lord.
