## Rules

The rules in *Islam* is for cleanliness in the case of lifting ritual impurity (*hadath*) or removal of impurities (*najasa*). When it comes the rules of the *shariah*, it depends on the situation. In some situations, it is obligatory, in others, it is *sunnah*, and in others, it is *mustahab*.

The proofs regarding this are as follows:

- From the *koran* (5:6): `وَإِن كُنتُمْ جُنُبًا فَٱطَّهَّرُوا۟ ۚ`

- From the *sunnah*:

  *Samurah bin Junbin* may God be pleased with him, said:

  > The prophet (ﷺ) said:
  >
  > > Whoever performs ablution on the day of *Jummah*, that is good and whoever takes a bath, that is better.

  ## How to perform the ritual bath
  
  ### The obligatory actions
  
  They are three
  
  1. **Rinsing**: washing the whole mouth. It is sufficient to drink in big gulps (that is, filling the mouth with water and then, swallow) because spitting water is not a condition.
  
  2. Sniffing water up the nostrils
  
  3. Making water flow over the whole body: It is required to wash all body parts that do not incur any difficulty, namely, the ears, the navel, the moustache, the eyebrows, the beard, the hair, the head and the haircloth (if present - one needs to make sure that water reachers the hair inside).
     Any part of the body that is difficult to wash is not incumbent, such as the eyes, blisters and small injuries. God most High has lifted difficulty by saying: 
  
     > Al Hajj: 78
  
  ### The sunnah actions
  
  1. The intention.
  2. Saying the *bismillah* at the beginning of the bath.
  3. Washing the hands three times.
  4. Washing the private parts whether or not it contains impurities.
  5. Washing the body from impurities if present to prevent spreading at the beginning of the bath. Here, the *sunnah* action relates to the timing of this action because the action itself is obligatory (to remove impurities from the body) but it taking place at the beginning is *sunnah*.
  6. Performing a complete ablution: One should delay the washing of the feet if one is performing the bath in a place where water stagnates
  7. Ensuring that water goes over the whole body three times, beginning with the head and then each side, starting with the right first.
  
  The proof for this method is shown by this narration:
  
  > *Ibn Abbas* (may God be pleased with him) said: 
  >
  > > My aunt *Maymunah* (may God be pleased with her) told me:
  > >
  > > > I came close to the messenger of God (ﷺ) while he was having a bath from major ritual impurity. He washed his two hands two or three times. Then, he placed his right hand in the water container and poured water on his private parts while washing with his left hand. Then he hit the earth with his left hand and rubbed it strongly. Then, he performed an ablution, similar to the one for praying. Then, he poured water on his head three times using water from the palm of his hand. Then, he washed the rest of his body. Then, he moved to another place to wash his legs. Then, he put his head scarf back on.
