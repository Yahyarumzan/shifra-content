# Decoding Surah al Quraish

## Overview

This chapter talks about the blessings of Allah, most Exalted, upon the people of *Makkah*, whilst they were in two states, namely, during the winter travels to *Yemen* and during the summer travels to *Sham* for the sake of trade. Indeed, Allah most High has bestowed two amazing blessings upon the *Quraish*, which are:

- The blessing of safety and protection
- The blessing of richness and facilitation


## Explanation

```
106:1 لِإِيلَـٰفِ قُرَيْشٍ
106:2 إِۦلَـٰفِهِمْ رِحْلَةَ ٱلشِّتَآءِ وَٱلصَّيْفِ
```

This `ل` is connected to the verb that comes later, namely, `فليعبدوا`. The meaning of `الايلاف` is keeping and protection. It was said: 

> The protecting man of the woman is intimate. 

And the explanation of this goes back to the facilitation and protection of Allah for the *Quraish* when they were travelling during the winter to *Yemen* and in summer, to *Sham*, as Allah says: `رحلة الشتاء والصيف`, which means, during the travels of winter and summer, which were for the purpose of trade in order to get food and clothing. They profited during their passing and they were kept safe and no one would attempt to harm them in any way for the people used to say: 

> These are the neighbours of the *Kabah*, their house is its sacredness. They are the people of Allah for they are the governors of the *Kabah*. Hence don't oppress them.

Allah fought the people of the elephant. He countered their plot by slaughtering them. The rank of the people of *Makkah* in the hearts was raised, and the greatness of their princes and kings increased and these benefits increased so that a test came upon the *Quraish* and a reminder of the blessings of Allah so that they may thank Him.

```
106:3 فَلْيَعْبُدُوا۟ رَبَّ هَـٰذَا ٱلْبَيْتِ
```

Therefore, they should worship Allah most Great, Lord of this ancient house and make their worship be gratitude for this amazing blessing that has been bestowed upon them. The scholars of tafsir said: 

> When the `ف` is added, it has the meaning of a condition as if it was said, if they do not worship due to the common or known blessings, they should at least worship Him because of the facilitation during the two travels as these are the clearest of blessings upon them, for they are from a place where no farming or agriculture is possible and this is also why the next verse follows.

```
106:4 ٱلَّذِىٓ أَطْعَمَهُم مِّن جُوعٍ وَءَامَنَهُم مِّنْ خَوْفٍۭ
```

This is the same God that fed them after the strength of famine and has protected them after the intensity of fear. Indeed they travelled safely, without anyone opposing or attacking them, whether they were travelling or stopping as Allah said:

```
29:67 أَوَلَمْ يَرَوْا أَنَّا جَعَلْنَا حَرَمًا آمِنًا وَيُتَخَطَّفُ النَّاسُ مِنْ حَوْلِهِمْ
```

This is by the blessing of the call of their great forefather, Ibrahim, peace be upon him when he said:

> O Allah, render or make this place safe

and His saying: 

> I have provided several kinds of fruits

Therefore, is it not incumbent on the *Quraish* to not depart from the worship of this Great God? The One who fed them from hunger and protected them from fear.
