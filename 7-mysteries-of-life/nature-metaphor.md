# Decoding Nature

## Our Metaphor

Many of you, myself included, may not be familiar with the world of biology and organisms that make up the core of life on earth. Since we currently live in an era where we are surrounded by machines such as robots and computers, and many of us have become very accustomed to them through daily use and exposure to them regularly, I thought it a good analogy to use specific machines as metaphors for each main aspect of nature that we will be tackling in this work.

List of metaphors:

- Excavator: roots
- Kite: leaves
