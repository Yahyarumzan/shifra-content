# Decoding Trees

## The life of a tree

A standing tree is outwardly motionless but inside a lot is in motion to keep the tree alive and growing:

- Roots pushing downwards in the earth looking for water and breaking elements in their way
- Leaves guiding the movement of branches looking for carbon and sunshine
- Arteries that move water from the roots to the sky and bring food to the roots
- Electrical discharges that transmit messages

### Roots: the bottom of the iceberg 

Roots are constantly moving through the ground in search for water, air and minerals, thereby encountering many adventures with friends and foes such as competing roots and animals, rocks, worms and insects and sometimes humans. 

#### Root caps

The end of each root is made of a root cap, which resembles a pointed shoe or shovel, and is constructured out of a tough, self-lubricating material that the root pushes ahead. As the outside of the root cap gets worn out, working against stones, teeth, running water or other opponents, the inside is replaced by cambium cell division[^fn1]. The root cap is helped by other tools such as powerful acids that help the root manoeuvre around the obstacles. It is backed up by a concentration of cambium known as the *meristem*, followed by a zone of elongation where root cells fill themselves with water and expand to push the cap ahead. Then, we have the zone of root hairs that provide the surface needed to absorb water from dry soil to maintain root growth.

#### Roots' matrix like intertwined stitches

The growth of the root happens very dynamically by each cell created in the cambium cell division, growing to multiple times its length in a day or so, growing its hairs the day after to absorb water and then being left behing as the root advances. The average tree needs a lot of water to survive. 

> For example, an ordinary cornstalk must drink and evaporate 50 gallons of water in order to reach maturity

Indeed, many plants have a lot of their body under the earth, about nine tenth in some cases with the roots being distributed in all directions.

> An innocent-looking little rye plant was measured to have 14 billion root hairs with an end-to-end length of 6000 miles and growing at a cumulative rate of 100 miles a day

As roots spread through the earth, they create a network of stitches that bind the central organism of the tree top to the ground

### Leaves: breathing moisturisers

Protective bud or growing tip backed by *meristem* that provides cell division which is then followed by a zone of elongation. The bud sprouts leaves that are used for breathing air to bring in carbon that is the most essential element for the tree's life.

> If you stick a tiny piece of leaf from an African violet into moist soil, it will normally grow roots directly out of the leaf.

Not only does it act as the nostrils for the tree, but also, it is composed of a complex system of valve-like and sensor-like devices that regulate the production of food from air based on external conditions and then circulate it down in the tree. In addition to this, these same tube-like systems act as a shelter structure. In between the valve-like systems, one can find *chloroplasts*[^fn2] which allow the leaf to access as much light and air as needed and they are arranged in a way to maximize volume and surface area.

The amount and rate of breathing is not constant but rather constantly re-adjusts based on internal need and external conditions. Mostly in the underside of a leaf, one will find pores that adjust in aperture size based on the amount of air needed and available. For example, when it is hot and dry, they remain thin slits whilst when it is cool and humid, they are wide open and even will allow moisture to evaporate back to the sky, as moisturisers.

The *chloroplats* change their shapes based on external conditions to absord the optimum amount of light needed. It is often not a straightforward linear decision process but rather a balance based on sometimes conflicting requirements.

> For example, choosing between closing pores to conserve water which slows breathing, and opening their pores to get more carbon dioxide which then dehydrates them through evaporation.
